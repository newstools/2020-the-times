President Cyril Ramaphosa has flatly dismissed speculation that he was planning to return the country to a hard  lockdown. Despite warnings of a Covid-19 resurgence, including from health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize, Ramaphosa said that a hard lockdown was not on the cards. Ramaphosa made the comment while taking oral questions from MPs in the National Council of Provinces on a range of issues, including Covid-19 corruption, gender-based violence and the controversial trip to Zimbabwe last month by defence minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula with the ANC in tow. Responding to a question from the DA's Tim Brauteseth, Ramaphosa that while he was concerned about the recent spike in Covid-19 infections, there was “no need to be alarmed”. Ramaphosa said that he received a report from a team advising his government on Covid-19 on Tuesday before his appearance before the NCOP, and he would be consider it before addressing the nation during next week. He said talk of a return to a hard lockdown was premature, adding that what was required for now was strict adherence to Covid-19 safety protocols — particularly as the festive season approached. This is a developing story.
