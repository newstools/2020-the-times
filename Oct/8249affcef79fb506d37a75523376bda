"Lockdown" was crowned the SA Word of the Year on Friday after being used nearly 500,000 times in six months. The term beat "Jerusalema", "corruption", "normalise", "self-isolation" and "Covid-19" for the award from the Pan South African Language Board (PanSALB) and media research company Focal Points. PanSALB chief executive Willie Manana said the prominence of these words were tracked from October 2019 to September 2020. The City of Cape Town has cancelled its annual festive lights switch-on event for 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to the city, the event draws a crowd of about 100,000 people annually and sets the tone for Cape Town’s festive season. “In light of the Covid-19 pandemic and the extension of the National Disaster Management Act restrictions on the number of people allowed at public gatherings, it was important to pause the event for the safety of all those who would be involved in the concert,” the city said in a statement.
