André Pienaar, the man  arrested for his alleged role in a fiery protest in the Free State, has been released on bail. Pienaar was denied bail in the Senekal magistrate’s court last week and approached the Bloemfontein high court to appeal that decision. The higher court granted his appeal and  put his bail at R15,000. Pienaar's case was postponed to November 20, said National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Free State spokesperson Phaladi Shuping. Pienaar was initially charged with malicious damage to property and public violence, but the court heard last week that he faced two additional charges — attempted murder and terrorism. He now faces charges of incitement to commit violence, public violence and attempted murder. Pienaar's lawyer, Jacques Potgieter, said: “He got bail in the amount of R15,000 and I can confirm he has already paid it and has been released from custody.” Meanwhile, the NPA  confirmed that Stephanus Johannes Fourie also appeared in court linked to the same incident as Pienaar. "[He] was granted bail of R15,000 by the Senekal magistrate's court. He is facing charges of public violence, attempted murder and incitement. The case was postponed to November 20 for further investigations. He will appear together with Andre Pienaar on that day,” said Shuping. TimesLIVE
