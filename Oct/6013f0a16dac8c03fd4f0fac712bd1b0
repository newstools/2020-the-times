Model, cookbook author and mother of two Chrissy Teigen did not see the loss of her third baby boy, Jack, coming. Just two days before the devastating loss, the model shared on Instagram that she and baby Jack were going for a blood transfusion. She said it sounded more dramatic than it was, saying: “It's an IV, but instead of fluids, the blood of some kind human being out there. Baby and I are completely fine, just missing the little things like walking, cooking and playing with the other two children, Luna and Miles.” Fans across the globe were mourning Chrissy's miscarriage, which she announced on Instagram on Thursday. “We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we've never felt before. We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions. It just wasn't enough,” reads an excerpt from her caption. Chrissy said she and husband John Legend don't name their children until they are born, but admitted they had started calling their unborn baby boy Jack. “He will always be Jack to us. Jack worked so hard to be part of our little family, and he will be, forever,” she wrote. She shared pictures of her holding her baby and another of her husband holding her hand while she lay on the hospital bed.
