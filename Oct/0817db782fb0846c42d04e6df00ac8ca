Support for New Zealand's ruling Labour Party was unchanged with just over a week to the general election and it continued to enjoy a double-digit lead over the main opposition party, an opinion poll showed on Thursday. The closely watched 1News-Colmar Brunton poll showed support for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's party, which is seeking a second term in office, at 47%, unchanged from the last poll on Sept. 28. The opposition National party was down by one percentage point at 32%. Smaller parties continued to get good support, the poll showed.
