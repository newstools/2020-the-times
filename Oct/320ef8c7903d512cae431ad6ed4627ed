A KwaZulu-Natal granny and her two grandchildren perished in a fire at their home in Nongoma, in the northern part of the province, on Friday night. According to the co-operative governance and traditional affairs department (Cogta), the fire is believed to have been caused by a candle. “Two children together with their grandmother perished from the severe burns they suffered as a result of the fire which engulfed their home. “The cause of the fire is unconfirmed at this stage but it is suspected that it could have been caused by a candle,” said a Cogta statement Cogta MEC Sipho Hlomuka dispatched a disaster management team “to provide immediate relief to the family and to investigate the possible causes of the fire”.
