Police spokesperson Capt Sandra Janse van Rensburg said an inquest docket has since been opened. Belinda Jonker, 64, died on the scene. According to Janse van Rensburg, at about 9.30pm on Monday, as Jonker and her husband were leaving their house in Summerville Street, Morningside, the family dog attacked her. “The deceased [Jonker] had difficulty getting into the car. “While her husband was busy assisting her, their four-year-old pit bull attacked her. “Her husband tried to get the dog off but was unable to assist his wife,” Janse van Rensburg said. The man, 66, alerted his neighbours, who finally managed to  pull the dog off the woman and tie him to a tree. “She sustained several wounds and was declared deceased on the scene. “Animal Anti-Cruelty League was called to remove the dog from the house,” Janse van Rensburg said.
