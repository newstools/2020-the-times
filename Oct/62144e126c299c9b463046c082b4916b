You can't ask me to do research for you, I don't know anything about that. Stop thinking people on TV know everything about everything. No! “My spaces are recruitment and training, I'm an actress and an entrepreneur. When you talk those languages that is when I may be able to help. But there's no way you can come to me and ask me about how people find funding for their farms.. I mean I don't know! That's why I don't have a farm myself.

Lusanda went on to tell her followers to approach the right people for advice and to stop thinking celebs with millions of followers can help them. Watch her two videos on the matter below:
