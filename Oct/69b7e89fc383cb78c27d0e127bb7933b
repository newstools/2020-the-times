It's been a tough year all round, but there's one thing that will make it all better: a trip for two to New York City, including flights and accommodation, visas, money for daily expenses ... and tickets to a live studio recording of Trevor Noah's The Daily Show! Every Sunday from October 11 to November 1 2020, a new competition crossword puzzle will be printed in the Sunday Times newspaper. To find the answers to these puzzles, you have to watch The Daily Show on Comedy Central (DStv channel 122) regularly, Tuesday to Friday from 10.30pm. Complete one or more of these four crossword puzzles, then SMS your name, surname, ID number and the overall answer (the grey highlighted word in each puzzle) to 40730. The more you enter, the better your chance to win. Terms and conditions apply. For full terms and conditions, the general competition rules and privacy policy, visit the Comedy Central Africa website.
