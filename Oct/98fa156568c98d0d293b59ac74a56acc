The case of seven people arrested in connection with the plundering of VBS Mutual Bank was postponed on Thursday  to January 26 next year. The seven men were making their second appearance at the Palm Ridge magistrate's court  after their first appearance in June. On Wednesday, their former co-accused, ex-VBS Bank CFO  Philip Truter, reached a plea and sentence agreement with the state, which saw him being sentenced to an effective seven-year jail term after pleading guilty to six counts, including corruption and fraud. The remaining accused are: Prosecutor Hein van der Merwe told the court that the reason the state sought a postponement was to amend the indictment to  add additional charges and  more accused. Van der Merwe said the state foresaw that by the next date, the additional accused  would have been  added, the indictment  finalised and trial date  set. Magistrate Jeremy Janse van Vuuren granted the postponement. The seven were provided with the indictment during their first appearance in June. The indictment sets out a raft of charges the men are facing, including money laundering, theft, fraud and corruption. In that indictment, Matodzi is accused of bribing all his co-accused and offering gratification in order to influence them “to act in a manner that amounts to the illegal, dishonest, unauthorised, incomplete, or biased exercise, carrying out or performance of any powers, duties or functions arising out of a statutory, contractual or any other legal obligation”.
