“Bheki Cele is so obsessed with alcohol but silent on gender-based violence (GBV) and human trafficking.” This is one of the remarks from people who expressed their dismay with the police minister after he, alongside members of the SA Police Service and Johannesburg metropolitan police department, raided a nightclub, Blackdoor, in Sandton in the early hours of Sunday morning. Videos of the raid were shared on social media by government officials. TimesLIVE reported that the manager of the  club was arrested for breaking the lockdown regulations. According to Cele's spokesperson Lirandzu Themba, liquor valued at more than R800,000 was seized during the raid. On social media, many called the raid a “PR exercise” and that Cele was “fighting the wrong crime” instead of the scourge of GBV and human trafficking in SA. In a written parliamentary response to the DA last week,  Cele revealed that more than 130 police officers have GBV charges hanging over their heads. The cases include rape, statutory rape, murder, domestic violence, attempted murder, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, contempt of court, malicious damage to property, intimidation, and pointing a firearm. Cele said most of the cases were reported in the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, the Free State and the Northern Cape. A few were also reported in the Eastern Cape, Limpopo, the North West, Mpumalanga and Gauteng. Here is a snapshot of what Mzansi had to say:
