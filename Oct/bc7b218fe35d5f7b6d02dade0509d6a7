Tuck and roll into October with these action-packed movies, series, talk shows and children’s shows, all brand new on Showmax.  International series  Based on the James Grady novel and the 1975 film adaptation Three Days of the Condor, Condor follows young CIA analyst Joe Turner, who is drawn into a deadly terrorist plot that threatens the lives of millions. Joe is played by Max Irons (The Wife — and the son of Oscar winner Jeremy Irons). Condor has an 86% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes and the Washington Post described it as “quite the little pulse-pounder — the sort of thing 24 fans can eat with a spoon”.  Kirsten Dunst (Fargo) was nominated for both a 2020 Golden Globe and a 2020 Critics’ Choice award for Best Actress in this comedy-drama about a minimum-wage water park employee who schemes her way up the ranks of the cultish multibillion-dollar pyramid scheme that drove her family to ruin. The series has an 85% critics’ rating on Rotten Tomatoes, where the critics’ consensus calls it, “a clever and absurd satire that will make you want to buy whatever Kirsten Dunst is selling”.  Years And Years is a six-part drama starring Emma Thompson which follows the lives of a single family over 15 years in Britain rocked by political, economic and technological change. The show has an 89% critics’ rating on Rotten Tomatoes, where the critics’ consensus says, “Years & Years scathingly critiques the present with a nihilistic projection of the future, leavening the devastating satire with a buoyant sense of humour and characters who are easy to become invested in.”  World-class thief Daisy “Jett” Kowalski is just out of prison and already being forced back into what got her there by a group of eccentric and dangerous criminals. Jett has a 94% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, where the consensus says, “Carla Gugino shines in Jett, a stylish — if overtly violent — noir that benefits from its willingness to crank its genre set pieces up to eleven.”  When Alex Rider learns that his Uncle Ian was killed in the line of duty as a British spy — and not a car accident like he’s been told — everything changes for this otherwise normal teen. Alex is approached by the head of a top-secret offshoot of MI6 who reveals that he’s been unknowingly trained since childhood for the world of espionage. Alex goes undercover to investigate the connection between the deaths of two billionaires and a remote boarding school. Based on the best-selling books by Anthony Horowitz, the series has an 81% critics’ score on Rotten Tomatoes, with Daily Telegraph hailing it as “a junior version of the Bourne franchise ... that can also keep adults entertained”.

LOCAL  Award-winning SA legend Desmond Dube (The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency, Hotel Rwanda) and Safta winner Nomsa Buthelezi (Lockdown, Isibaya) star in this hilarious SA family film about Doris Ratabane (Buthelezi), a lady with oodles of can-do attitude, and a limited amount of patience. Doris has had enough of crime ... and the empty promises of the police commissioner. Then she meets a mysterious Kung Fu master and decides to take matters into her own hands, causing all sorts of problems for those around her.  Cut-Out Girls is the story of how six young women’s lives are affected by the actions of two aspiring sportsmen. Filmed in Cape Town, it’s the debut film from Safta-nominated actress Nicola Hanekom (Faan se Trein, Hard Copy), based on her award-winning stage play about rape culture.  Sangomas are perhaps the most misunderstood of SA’s faith-based communities. But modern traditional healers are far removed from the stereotypes many associate with the practice. This Mzansi Magic reality/docuseries follows two young ghobelas (senior sangomas and initiators) juggling their calling with motherhood and their careers — Ngwe is a nurse, Maweni is an event planner — as they face challenges and triumphs, both as healers and in their personal lives, and guide their own senior class of amathwasane towards completing their initiation.
