Elaborating on the regulations  referred to by President Cyril Ramaphosa during his announcement  on the commencement of  lockdown level 1, minister of international relations & co-operation Naledi Pandor reiterated the need for travel insurance when coming into the country. “Everyone travelling to SA must have travel insurance. This is in case they need to get tested on arrival, which will be done at their own cost. Further, if the person tests positive they will also need to go into quarantine at their own cost,” said Pandor.
