The star described the scrumptious food his lover makes for him. “How I wish you guys can taste my husband's samp. Damn, it's the best! Creamy, tasty, with small chunks of potatoes, served with chicken gizzards hearts and necks stew. The perfect Sunday kos after work,” said Somizi. Fans were totally jelly of the couple, wishing they too could have a partner to cook them a gourmet meal of love.
