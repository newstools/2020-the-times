Rock-throwing protesters briefly brought traffic to a stop on Johannesburg's key N14 highway on Thursday afternoon following a protest that spilled over from an informal settlement. A video posted on the Florida community policing forum's Facebook page shows motorists making hurried U-turns and fleeing against the oncoming traffic while people and burning tyres block both lanes. Metro police briefly closed the highway this afternoon near the Randburg/Zwartkop interchange with Beyers Naude Drive. JMPD spokesman Wayne Minnaar told TimesLIVE that the road had since been been reopened to traffic. He could not say what had sparked the protest which had erupted in Mogale City, outside  the JMPD's jurisdiction. According to an unverified report in the Roodepoort Record, the protest started after Eskom cut the power to a large section of Muldersdrift to allow their technicians and  the Red Ants to remove illegal power connections at nearby informal settlements. The police have not yet responded to requests for comment. TimesLIVE
