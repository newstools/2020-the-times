Police minister Bheki Cele has said that if the gun used  to murder  Bafana Bafana keeper Senzo Meyiwa has  been found, it should be used to solve the case. “The gun found shouldn't make the news, it should finalise and resolve the case,” he said. Cele declined to give an update or confirm whether a gun and the suspect linked to the murder  had been found. “It's a pity that you have to answer things that you are not responsible for ... I heard that it was leaked so how do you expect the minister to answer on leaked issues, so I will leave them leaked,” he said. He was responding to questions by journalists on Wednesday  after a News24 article which alleged Meyiwa's 2014 murder has been linked to a man  now serving time for murdering a taxi boss and that the gun used was already in police custody. Cele was in KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday, where premier Sihle Zikalala and the province's executive council held a meeting on crime in the province. Zikalala said that presentations at the engagement painted a grim picture and showed the seriousness and escalating levels of crime in the province. “What was more concerning was that there are areas which in the past 10 years or more have featured continuously on the national list of leading stations when it comes to crimes such as murder and sexual assault,” said Zikalala.
