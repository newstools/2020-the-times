Controversial businessman Thoshan Panday and former police officer  Navin Madhoe appeared in the Durban magistrate's court on Friday in connection with corruption relating to a multimillion-rand police tender. They are accused of corruption linked to  2010 Fifa  World Cup police tenders involving about R47m.

The third person arrested didn't immediately appear in court. They are expected to appear in court again on November 11 when the indictment is expected to be served. TimesLIVE
