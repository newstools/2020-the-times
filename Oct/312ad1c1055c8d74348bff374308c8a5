The theme is #HopeOnTheRise: Cape Town kiters gathered at Dolphin Beach for a flash fly on day 2 of the virtual Cape Town International Kite Festival in support of Cape Mental Health. The event runs to  October 31 and aims to raise R250,000 to provide free mental health services. Sunday Times photographer Esa Alexander was there on day two to photograph some of the kites.
