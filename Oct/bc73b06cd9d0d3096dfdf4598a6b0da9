Contradictions emerged at the Randburg magistrate's court on Thursday as Lt-Col Johannes Venter was cross-examined by defence lawyer Laurence Hodes regarding the dispute between the colonel and two EFF leaders at Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's funeral in 2018. Venter had previously told the court he had  sought medical attention after the incident but later said  he did  not. He also told the court there were no permits required at the cemetery but decided to check  whether Malema and Ndlozi's vehicle was accredited  as part of the convoy. Hodes suggested that Venter had been letting cars in without checking and specifically targeted the car carrying the EFF  leader and then-spokesperson. Malema said there was “no case” as he addressed his supporters outside the court. He  said he would let his defence attorney handle the matter while he focuses on “winning government”. The case has been postponed to March 9.
