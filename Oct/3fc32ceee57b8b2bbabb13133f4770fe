Pitso Mosimane has been introduced to the facilities at Al Ahly Sports Club’s magnificent main complex on Zamalek Island in Cairo. Videos released by Al Ahly — one edited and one live — showed Mosimane being given the grand tour of the changerooms‚ trophy room and general sports facilities of the 113-year-old African Club of the Century at their complex on the banks of the Nile. Mosimane has signed  a two-year contract with Africa’s most successful club — the eight-time Caf Champions League winners and 42-time Egyptian league champions — having resigned as coach of Mamelodi Sundowns on Tuesday night. Mosimane toured the facility with the two ex-Sundowns technical staff members he has arrived with at Ahly — fitness trainer Kabelo “KB” Rangoaga and performance analyst Musi Matlaba. TimesLIVE
