The company said it wants to â€œoffer different products for different cities to provide options and pricing that resonate with different people". Here's where you can you find UberNam Riders in Johannesburg can access the cheaper option from areas including Katlehong, Alexandra, Boksburg and Benoni. In Cape Town, the option is available to riders in areas including Paarl, Wellington and Somerset west. What about the airport? The option will not be available to riders who are travelling to and from Durban, Cape Town or Johannesburg airports. How do you open the option? Riders can select UberNam from the app among other ride options UberX and UberXL. UberNam is noticeably cheaper than the two options and allows multiple passengers at a time, much like a taxi.

Drivers will be given a R6 bonus for taking on UberNam riders. The more they use it, the higher the bonus. What do people say?
