Zimbabwe has hinged its budget on a good agricultural season, increased mining revenue and a stable currency. The country's finance and economic development minister Prof Mthuli Ncube on Thursday presented his 2021 national budget, which he believes will work  if these criteria are met. He is also pinning hopes on a tourism recovery, which will depend on  the Covid-19 pandemic  not worsening. As such, the 2021 budget has an â€œexpenditure ceiling of ZW$421.6bn [US$5.08bn, or R77.33bn]", he said. Development partners were expected to lend or give the country a total of US$841.5m (R12.81bn), of which $282.1m (R4.29bn) would come from multilateral partners. Ncube is projecting a 7.4% overall GDP growth, with year-on-year inflation by the end of 2021 reaching 9%. These are some of the highlights of the budget: The government has proposed a ban on the importation of second-hand motor vehicles aged 10 years and more. TimesLIVE
