Lobby group AfriForum and trade union Solidarity's move to open a criminal case against EFF leader Julius Malema “for inciting violence” and threatening police has drawn mixed reaction on social media. AfriForum and Solidarity announced the decision in a joint statement this week, claiming that more than 1,000 police officers had shared their concerns about Malema's statements. “The civil rights organisation AfriForum and Solidarity trade union today laid criminal charges of defamation, conspiracy to incite violence and assault by means of threats at the Lyttelton police station against Julius Malema, leader of the EFF. “More than 1,000 police officers have approached Solidarity to express their concern about threatening statements Malema recently made against members of the SA Police Service (SAPS)." An extract from AfriForum's complaint includes Malema's remarks which he made on Sunday during a community meeting in Mohokare, Free State. “If SA police want to fight they must declare it. We will treat them the same way we treated them in the '80s. We will not only fight them at the picket lines, we will go to their homes and fight them in their own houses with their own families,” Malema told supporters at the meeting. He was responding to police using stun grenades and water cannons to disperse EFF supporters who went to protest at Brackenfell in Cape Town on Friday last week. The protest was against alleged racism, after it was reported a group of parents at Brackenfell High School held a private, unofficial matric ball which was only attended by white pupils. The decision to lay charges against Malema sparked fierce debate on social media. Those who sided with Malema accused AfriForum of attacking him, while others commended the organisation for seeking accountability. Here are some of the reactions:
