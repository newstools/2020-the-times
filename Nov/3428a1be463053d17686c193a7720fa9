She said she didn't know where she caught the virus or from whom. “Covid-19 is real guys. There is a second wave of the virus in town and it is spreading really fast. I can’t say for sure where I caught it but the worst thing for me was contact tracing. “Having to call people I have been exposed to, to tell them to quarantine and trace people they have also been exposed to. The whole thing is a mess.” Toke said she was sharing her experience on the vlog as the road to recovery is “a lot”. “I am tired all the time, I have a bit of memory loss and I’m trying to find out what day is what.” Feeling for her friend and what she was going through, Bonang joined Toke’s fans and followers  who wished her a speedy recovery.
