He would promise them a job, and instead, they would end up brutally raped and robbed of their possessions. Now, 25-year-old KwaZulu-Natal man Tumelo Khiba can no longer terrorise the women of Pinetown. Instead, he will be sitting behind bars after receiving six life terms and an additional 35 years in the Pinetown regional court on Friday. Between October 2016 and January 2017, Khiba lured several unsuspecting victims — all aged between 17 and 23 — with the promise of casual work. He would then drag them into the bushes near Manors  outside Pinetown where he would rape and rob them. These details came to light in the court this week, but Khiba’s activities had carried on up to this year and he was finally apprehended. On  January 10, he asked a 17-year-old to accompany him to the shops to buy a uniform for his daughter. From there, he carried on with his usual modus operandi. He took her into the bushes, raped her, and took her phone and cash. A case  of rape and robbery was opened in Pinetown SAPS and transferred to the Pinetown Family Violence, Child Protection  and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation. The next day, he was found and arrested along Old Main Road where he used to stalk his victims. “DNA analysis was conducted he was successfully linked to 11 other rape cases committed in the same vicinity. He made several appearances while being held in custody until his sentence,”  police spokesperson Col Thembeka Mbele said. KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner Lt-Gen Khombinkosi Jula praised the investigator for doing quality work which could lead to the conviction and sentence of the accused. TimesLIVE
