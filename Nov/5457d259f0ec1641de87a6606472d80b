Pitso Mosimane and his technical staff got down and boogied in the Al Ahly change room shortly after steering the continental giants to a ninth Caf Champions League title with Friday night’s 2-1 win in the final against bitter Cairo rivals Zamalek. YouTube videos gave an insight into the post-match celebrations in the change rooms of Cairo International Stadium. As for assistant-coach Cavin Johnson — seated in the rear in the video seemingly checking messages on his phone — the ex-AmaZulu and Platinum Stars coach was just too cool to even jive, preferring to savour a quiet moment sporting his characteristic cheeky grin. Kudos.
