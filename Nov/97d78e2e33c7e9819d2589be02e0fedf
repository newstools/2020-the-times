Focalistic went on to say that he is happy to make his mama proud by giving her something to put up on her wall. “When I got my degree, I lost the paper and my mom was sad because she wanted to frame it. Today, I gave her the gold plaque and she couldn’t be happier,  her face with tears of joy. Calling the whole fam! Dankie Ke Star! Let’s go platinum,” said the star. Congrats!
