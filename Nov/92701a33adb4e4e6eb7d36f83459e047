ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule handed himself  over to the Hawks at their offices in Bloemfontein on November 13 2020. He was later released on bail of R200,000 at the Bloemfontein magistrate's court after he made his first appearance. Magashule said he did not have money, adding that people had to contribute towards his  bail. He is facing charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering. Hundreds of supporters gathered outside the court in support of Magashule and waited patiently for  him to address them once he was out of court. In his address, Magashule  threatened to release information next week that would shake things up, but did not reveal any details. The court case is postponed to  February 19  2021. TimesLIVE
