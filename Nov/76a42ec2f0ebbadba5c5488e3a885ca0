Reimagined and well-made, Fitch & Leedes Classics have been crafted to keep the much-loved nostalgic taste that made these classics so popular, while being refreshed for today’s consumer. Fitch & Leedes Classics will take you down memory lane with time cherished retro favourites. Classics Ginger Beer has the authentic fiery kick of ginger spice. Classics Passionade is a modern twist on passion fruit and lemonade, while Classics Lime Twist is a refreshing take on lime and soda.

We took the classics and refreshed them to appeal to the modern-day consumer who is looking for convenience and a healthier, tastier option,” says Chill Beverages marketing manager James Shaw.
