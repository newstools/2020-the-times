Leader of the Enlightened Christian Gathering church and self-proclaimed “prophet” Shepherd Bushiri has thanked members of his congregation and pastors around the world for their support after he and his wife were arrested and released on bail. “Thank you to all bishops, apostles, evangelists, pastors, teachers and all ministers of the gospel all over the world for all your prayers and support for the past 15  days we were in custody ... Before religious affiliations, there is God, and that is where we all meet,” he wrote on Facebook. Bushiri, his wife Mary and two co-accused were granted bail on Wednesday by the Pretoria magistrate's court.

They were arrested in October for alleged fraud, theft and money laundering relating to a R102m investment scheme. Magistrate Thandi Theledi told the couple not to intimidate state witnesses as she read the bail conditions, which also include: Shortly after his release, Bushiri addressed a virtual service where he said they are “a subject of media scrutiny and trial”.
