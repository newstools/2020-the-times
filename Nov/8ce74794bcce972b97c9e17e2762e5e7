It’s been a year unlike any other faced by a matric class in SA. The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted schooling in so many ways, but still you’ve done the hard work and survived the exams. Now it’s time to claim your well-deserved fame by registering on our matric results website. If you're writing matric in 2020, click on matric.sowetanlive.co.za right now to sign up – it's quick and easy. There is even a cash prize of R10,000 up for grabs for one lucky matriculant! When the results are released in February – a bit later than usual due to the pandemic – we will email you an alert so you can find your results on our website alongside a bunch of fascinating information about the performance of your school and province, for example. You can only register a profile until February 22 2021 – the day before most of the country's National Senior Certificate results are released.
