Tanzania's re-elected president John Magufuli has re-appointed Philip Mpango as finance minister, the president's spokesman said in a statement on Friday. Magufuli won re-election last month with a landslide 84% of the vote although the opposition rejected the result, alleging various irregularities. In the statement Gerson Msigwa, the director of presidential communications said the president had also re-appointed Palamagamba Kabudi as minister of foreign affairs.
