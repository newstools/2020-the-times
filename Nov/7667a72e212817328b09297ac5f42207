The Sunday Times e-edition is an exact digital replica of our print edition, delivered via a service called PressReader. You can page through the newspaper online, via your internet browser or by using our e-edition app. (Note: some PressReader users may have previously had access to our e-edition via their general bundle packages on that platform. From November 13 2020, the Sunday Times e-edition is only available directly via the steps set out below.) The e-edition is available for subscribers only. A subscription costs as little as R80 per month (which includes access to Sunday Times Daily published every weekday). View our subscription offers here.
