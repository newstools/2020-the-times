The winners of the seventh annual International Landscape Photographer of the Year Awards have been revealed, showcasing 101 incredible landscape photos taken all over the world. Professional and amateur photographers around the globe were invited to enter the competition, which every year collects the top images into a book, which is available online and can be bought in hardcover. Out of more than 3,800 entries, here are some that were chosen as the best for 2020: The International Landscape Photographer of the Year title recognises the skill and discipline it takes to consistently capture outstanding images.

This year's winner is Kelvin Yueng of Hong Kong, who won with these four — the image above and the three below. This is the competition's second major prize, awarded for a single spectacular shot.
