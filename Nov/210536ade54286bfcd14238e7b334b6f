Singer Loyiso Gijana has had it with rapper L-Tido, who he believes acts like he's a "god" and treats people like "filth". The singer took to Twitter  to reveal how his recent encounter with L-Tido left him losing all respect for the Dlala ka Yona hitmaker. Loyiso let it be known in his tweet how he didn't care if L-Tido had been in the game for a long time because, according to him, that did not justify L-Tido not being respectful. "Treat everyone with kindness," he  advised the rapper. As many scratched their heads wondering who Loyiso was talking about, he let it be known he was referring to the hip hop heavyweight tagging him in the re-tweet. While the formerÂ Idols SA contestant called him out and dragged his name on the TL, L-Tido went about life as normal and didn't respond to the singer's remarks.
