The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) turned to the labour court on Thursday seeking an urgent interdict to stop retrenchments at Comair. The union wants the court to: The matter was scheduled  to get under way on Thursday afternoon. Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim said in an affidavit filed to court that the application sought to address “as a matter of urgency” the unfairness of the airline’s decision to start the retrenchment process. Jim contended that the respondents in the matter, which include Comair, the BRPs and Solidarity trade union, were conducting retrenchments in an “unlawful and unfair” manner. Numsa believed the BRPs were planning to retrench about 400 employees. Spokesperson for the business rescue practitioners, Stephen Forbes, said about Numsa’s court challenge: “We don’t believe Numsa’s application has any basis in fact or in law and are defending it. “While retrenchments are regrettable, what is at stake here is the jobs of the majority of Comair employees.” TimesLIVE
