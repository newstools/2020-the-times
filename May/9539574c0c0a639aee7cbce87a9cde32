Former Cape Town teacher Yamina Oliver, 90, has become an instant celebrity for taking daily walks during the level 4 lockdown exercise period. Every morning, when she dons her face shield and takes her walker for a stroll along Sea Point promenade, fellow - and faster - fitness enthusiasts greet her with smiles and waves. “I taught for 50 years and I actually taught until 80,” Oliver told TimesLIVE on Thursday. “I used to walk in the morning and in the evening. But now I only do it in the morning. “I love teaching, and what is so nice about teaching is that everybody here, who I don’t know, knows me because I taught them - and others I taught their children and grandchildren.” She dusted off her takkies when President Cyril Ramaphosa relaxed the lockdown restrictions and allowed outdoor exercise. “I couldn’t breathe with the other thing that I put on my nose, so my physiotherapist recommended this [a face shield] and I love it,” she said. “It’s beautiful [out here] and also when everybody walks past it’s a pleasure because I don’t’ walk so fast. I get a bit lonely if there is no jogger. “The other day a cop stopped me and I thought he was going to take me away ... and he asked where I stay and said he is going to come and fetch me every morning. “Everybody is so friendly. I don’t see so well and I forget their names. But I love it.”
