As a nation, we are resilient in times of adversity. Our spirit of generosity and ubuntu unites us to fight against any challenge. This time it has been no different. We're celebrating both our beautiful country and its people who have done so much for others in need during the Covid-19 lockdown. Nominate a lockdown hero from your community and tell us why they deserve the title, and you and your hero could each win a holiday worth R15,000 anywhere in SA.
