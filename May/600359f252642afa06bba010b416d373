Most of South Africa will be placed in level 3 of the nationwide lockdown by the end of May, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Wednesday. But high-risk areas will remain on level 4, he added. He said a consultation process on how the move to level 3 will work will start happening “immediately”. "If we lift the lockdown too abruptly and too quickly, we risk a rapid and unmanageable surge in infections. We will therefore continue to proceed cautiously," he said in an address to the nation. This is a developing story.
