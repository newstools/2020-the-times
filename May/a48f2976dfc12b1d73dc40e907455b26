The EFF has opposed the mooted lifting of the ban on alcohol sales when the country moves to level three of the Covid-19 lockdown next month. However, the party is mum on the possible end of the ban on cigarette sales. Julius Malema, the leader of EFF, has on several occasions admitted to the party taking money from controversial businessman Adriano Mazzotti, who is alleged to be a big player in the illicit trade on cigarettes. Malema has openly boasted about his friendship with Mazzotti. “The intention to permit the sale of alcohol will only worsen the situation because even when there is no effort to contain a pandemic, alcohol has been responsible for many health-related and social ills in society,” said EFF spokesperson Vuyani Pambo. The party on Friday said it was opposed to the reopening of schools  on June 1 unless 11 “non-negotiable” conditions are met by government. The EFF said schools should remain closed until there is: The party added that it was also opposed to the gradual reopening of the economy which they believe only serves the interests of big business. According to the EFF, the easing of the lockdown regulations should only happen when the Covid-19 daily infection rate is below 45 people. “Currently, daily infections exceed 1,000. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has already said that SA is not ready to ease the lockdown regulations,” said Pambo.
