DJ Euphonik found himself on the Twitter trends list on Wednesday for a heated back and forth, after one Twitter user accused him of allegedly having vested interests in encouraging people to buy property amid the Covid-19 pandemic. It all started when the person shared that the reduced prime rate meant it was a good time to buy property. User Koshiek Karan responded to the tweet, saying: “It's almost like interest rates never go up.” He continued: “If a DJ who is paid by a property development company tells you to buy a house, do you think he gives a f**k about you?” Euphonik owns properties and works with Balwin Properties, helping them market  their properties. He also partnered with bond originator Betterbond and hosts Property Matters, a television show which teaches people all about the property market. The DJ jumped into the debate claiming  there is a lot of opportunity in the market at the moment. Euphonik added that while many knew him for his music, he also knew a thing or two about property. The user responded to Euphonik, saying purchasing property during a pandemic was “both reckless and self-motivated”. He later claimed the DJ had a self motivated interest for people to acquire properties, which Euphonik responded to. The debate continued when the user claimed that Euphonik had steered clear of disclosing his self-interests and should take the L.
