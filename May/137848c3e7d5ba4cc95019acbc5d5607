With salons and hairdressers closed during the nationwide lockdown, author and actress Ayanda Borotho has created a platform to help those struggling to “tame” their hair. Ayanda has been vocal on social media about pressing issues that affect many people and businesses during the lockdown, and took to Instagram this week to speak about the affect the regulations had on hairdressers. “My heart goes out to small business owners who are really suffering during this time. I have been engaging with my hairdresser, Mary from Ghana, and you'd know that many hairdressers in our salons are not from home. “My plea to you is that if you know of anybody whose a hairdresser that you absolutely adore and love, please don't forget them, assist them where you can.” The actress also mentioned hair care manufacturers who depend on salons to buy products from them, and encouraged her fans to buy the products if they can. She said that by doing so they would help keep businesses alive. “If you can and still have the buying and spending power please buy South African products to support businesses, so that their doors will be opened during this trying time. “I want to do a little challenge where we talk about hair in the time of coronavirus. What have been your struggles knowing that you can't go to the salon? How have you been maintaining your hair and how do you feel about your hair,” she asked.
