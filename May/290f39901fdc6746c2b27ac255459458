A warrant of arrest has been issued for an allegedly drunk man who was caught on video sleeping in his car under lockdown,  with a bottle of whisky in the vehicle. The driver of a BMW was, according to the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD), found inside the stationary vehicle on Kliprivier Road before midnight on Saturday, two weeks ago. The car's engine  was running when the man was found. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said the man  had been released on warning and was told to appear in court, but  did not present himself. “The accused was not before court and a warrant of arrest was issued,” Mjonondwane said. He is due to appear in court on Tuesday. In the video, the man can be heard shouting from the back of the JMPD van. “Why are you arresting me? You found me sleeping in my car. There is no charge,” he is heard saying. He accuses the JMPD of wanting a bribe from him. He can also be heard hurling insults at an officer. “This guy is driving a BMW. Inside the boot are food parcels. He is drinking an 18 [year-old] Glenfiddich,” the officer can be heard saying. “Officers found the driver and [a] passenger sleeping. Officers had to wake both up and the driver became abusive. Officers found a liquor bottle inside  the car,” said JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minaar. He said the man was arrested for drunk driving. He is alleged to have damaged the windows of the JMPD vehicle during the arrest. “He was also charged for malicious damage to property and contravention of Covid-19 regulations. [His] passenger was also arrested and charged with contravention of Covid-19 regulation for being out on a public road at night,” Minaar said.
