Two inmates have died of Covid-19 in an East London prison, the correctional services department said on Tuesday. Both had "underlying comorbid conditions," said spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo. A third inmate death - this one at a Western Cape facility - was "under investigation". There have been an additional six cases of inmates at the East London prison testing positive, for a national total of 165 within the correctional services sector. According to figures provided by Nxumalo on Tuesday: Speaking about the 60 recoveries in total, Nxumalo said this was a "clear indication of the effectiveness of the containment and treatment pillar" of its Covid-19 disaster management response strategy. "Under the strategy, there is rapid identification of laboratory-confirmed cases, and inmates who test positive are isolated and have access to quality healthcare that enable their recovery," he said. Of the six new cases in East London, he said healthcare practitioners were already on site "providing an array of health services".
