However, Menzi's wife Sikie Ngubane slammed the reports. “I would like to confirm that my husband is receiving family support and recuperating after doctors were concerned about his health.” The veteran's family said they were concerned that Menzi's condition was exaggerated and urged South Africans to avoid spreading fake news. “The family is also aware that due to the spread of this inaccurate and unverified news, his fans have even gone as far as sending their messages of his speedy recovery on social media, spawning an unwarranted social media panic. We understand their concerns and support for Menzi, but as the family, we appeal to South Africans to refrain from spreading news that has not been verified and confirmed by the family.” Sikie concluded by saying they wish to continue as the family to offer her husband the support he needed after his recent visit to the doctors. “It is this visit that has been grossly exaggerated by newspapers and social media users.”
