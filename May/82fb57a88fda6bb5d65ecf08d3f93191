An investigation has been launched into a fight between police officers at a station in George, Western Cape. A video of the altercation has been widely shared on social media. Southern Cape police spokesperson Capt Malcolm Pojie confirmed  the incident happened at the Conville police station on May 7. Pojie said preliminary investigations suggested two off-duty officers from the Pacaltsdorp station visited friends in La Vallia and became “disorderly”. Conville police officers were dispatched after a complaint was laid, he said. He said the officers were arrested for contravention of the Disaster Management Act  and taken to the Conville station where they were processed at the police holding cells. “It was then that they became riotous again and members had to use force to restrain them." Pojie said the officers involved faced criminal charges and disciplinary action. He said the matter had also been reported to the Independent Police Directorate.
