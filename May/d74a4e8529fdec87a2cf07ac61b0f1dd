Covid-19 lockdown levels will be implemented at district level and will be reviewed every two weeks, health minister Zweli Mkhize said on Thursday. Writing for BusinessLIVE, Mkhize said districts would be assessed according to the average number of active cases they had over a week. “Depending on the average active cases per 100,000 people, districts will be individually assigned levels of lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus,” he said. “The case numbers will be monitored and the National Command Council will review the level of lockdown per district every two weeks.” Oversight structures in each district, which Mkhize described as “intersectoral and interdepartmental”, would oversee the regulations that related to each level of lockdown. “Community organisations — specifically local government, civil society, religious organisations and community policing forums — will be empowered to monitor compliance and enforce regulation,” he said. “This should mobilise communities together, rather than create hostility against members of the police and the army.” Mkhize said more needed to be done to bolster the health-care system, and districts should each have “a dedicated rapid response team to intervene should there be cluster outbreaks while screening, testing and case management is conducted”.
