President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday addressed the nation after 19 days  of silence. Mzansi called on its leader to provide an update on the spread of the coronavirus and the country's lockdown regulations. And he did. Kinda. Ramaphosa said that most of the country would move to level 3 at the end of May. That's around three weeks to go. He said there would be changes to existing regulations around level 4. He made reference to the easing of rules around exercising. That's it. The president said that while some areas would move to level 3, those "hot spots" with higher infection rates may remain at level 4. Er, that's it for now. As per usual, more details will be released by ministers tomorrow.
