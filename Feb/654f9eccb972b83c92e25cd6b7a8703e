There are many things that come into play when we consider what characteristics define our notions of beauty. Aesthetic appeal, social significance, sustainability, economic impact, a momentary relief from our busy lives, entertainment, cultural flavour and even humour are all things that the design fundis and cultural commentators who recently nominated their Most Beautiful Object for 2020 took into account. This year a wide range of designs were elected to be in the top 10. These are the nominations: To see images of the objects and vote for your favourite visit www.designindaba.com. The winner will be announced at the event. This is just a taste of what the Design Indaba will be bringing to Cape Town and via its simulcast service to Potchefstroom, Nairobi, Durban, Johannesburg and Namibia.
