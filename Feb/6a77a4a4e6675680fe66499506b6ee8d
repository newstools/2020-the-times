Registration at the embattled University of KwaZulu-Natal is expected to continue uninterrupted after a resolution was reached regarding the clearing of historical debt for returning students. According to a statement released by KwaZulu-Natal premier Sihle Zikalala's office on Friday, a resolution was found after education MEC Kwazi Mshengu met  university managers, led by vice-chancellor Prof Nana Poku, the student representative council  (SRC), the South African Union of Students (SAUS) and the UKZN convocation committee. Mshengu was assigned to chair the task team, set up by Zikalala last week in a bid to find a solution to the various issues. The university has been plagued by unrest over the past three weeks as returning students demanded the clearing of historical debt. Zikalala urged students to desist from expressing their frustrations by protesting and damaging university property and rather opting  for dialogue to resolve problems. Some of the decisions taken at the meeting between Mshengu, the university and student formations included that: The provincial government praised the SRC and convocation for their contributions of R4m and R1m, respectively. SCR president Sifiso Simelane was not immediately available to comment on where the R4m came from. On Monday Duduzane Zuma reportedly said he planned to offer financial aid to students on a video that was circulated widely on social media platforms. "We will sit down, I will come to you," Zuma said in the video. Despite numerous attempts, TimesLIVE was unable to reach Zuma to confirm whether he would provide financial assistance for students with historical debt. However Simelane said on Wednesday that he had been speaking to people in Zuma's office. “Duduzane confirmed he will help UKZN students in whatever way possible. One of the needs of students is financial assistance," said Simelane.
