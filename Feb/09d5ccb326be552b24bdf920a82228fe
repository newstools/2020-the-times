The 2020 state of the nation address (Sona) was more than just about the president outlining his plan of action on tackling some of SA's challenges, such as unemployment, the ailing economy and embattled state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Members of the EFF delivered on their promise to disrupt President Cyril Ramaphosa'sÂ  address by calling for the axing of public enterprises ministerPravin Gordhan and the dismissal of former president FW de Klerk from the house. National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise suspended the Sona after more than an hour of EFF disruptions. Here are five moments from the Sona: Mbuyiseni Ndlozi to Boy Mamabolo South Africans are not proud- Thandi Modise Sona suspension by Thandi Modise We're held to ransom by a minority- Mangosuthu Buthelezi EFF walks out of parliament after Sona reconvened Ramaphosa and deputy president David Mabuza meet Springbok captain Siya Kolisi and Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi
