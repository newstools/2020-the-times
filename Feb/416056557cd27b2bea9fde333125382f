A rioting crowd set fire to three buildings on Friday after the court appearance of a man accused of kidnapping and murdering eight-year-old Tazne van Wyk. The buildings were near Goodwood magistrate's court, in Cape Town, where Moydine Pangarker's appearance was delayed for 90 minutes by a crowd of protesters who forced their way into the building. Community members said the buildings targeted by the crowd - which also included a shop, which was looted - were known as “illicit drug outlets”. After overturning a car, the crowd abducted alleged sex workers and a suspected drug-dealer from one of the buildings and dragged them around nearby streets, forcing them to point out properties where drugs are sold. “It's essentially a lynch-mob rampaging through the area,” said a bystander. TimesLIVE was told that one of the buildings that was set alight was targeted after people who left court once Pangarker was remanded in custody, told the crowd the 54-year-old had kept Tazne there after kidnapping her on February 7. Residents said the area was plagued by drug-dealers and that they supported the actions of the protesters who attacked the buildings. Police eventually used stun grenades to disperse the crowd and firefighters arrived to tackle the blazes.
