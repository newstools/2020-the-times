While politicians gathered in parliament ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa's state of the nation address (Sona) on Thursday, former Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba spent his night leading a shade festival. Posting pictures of politicians in their fancy dresses, extravagant jewellery and high heels, Mashaba compared the images to the poor and neglected in SA. Adding a double dose of spice, Mashaba took shots at interim DA leader John Steenhuisen. Public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane and police minister Bheki Cele were also targeted.
