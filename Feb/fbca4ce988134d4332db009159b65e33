Chaos erupted at the University of KwaZulu-Natal's (UKZN) Westville campus early on Wednesday. Videos of students wearing balaclavas, and with T-shirts covering their faces, as they faced off with university security personnel circulated on social media. A UKZN official said members of public order policing unit had been deployed to the campus to restore calm. In a statement on Wednesday, UKZN said the academic programme would continue despite the interruptions. Students reportedly remain aggrieved by issues surrounding historic debt and financial exclusion. This is a developing story.
