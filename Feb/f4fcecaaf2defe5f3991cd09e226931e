Parliament has confirmed that former president Jacob Zuma will join MPs and dignitaries in Cape Town for President Cyril Ramaphosa’s state of the nation (Sona) address on Thursday. On its official Twitter account, parliament said former presidents Zuma, Kgalema Motlanthe and Thabo Mbeki would attend. Zuma missed both the 2018 and 2019 Sonas. Last week, Zuma made headlines after he skipped his court appearance citing a medical condition. TimesLIVE reported that judge Dhaya Pillay then issued a warrant of arrest for Zuma. The warrant was stayed until May 6 for Zuma’s next court appearance. Zuma's defence team had submitted a sick note which was dismissed by Pillay as it did not contain enough relevant information and the dates appeared to have been altered. Zuma faces multiple charges of fraud, graft and racketeering related to the 1990s arms deal struck when he was deputy president to Thabo Mbeki.
