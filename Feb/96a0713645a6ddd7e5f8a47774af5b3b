Former president Jacob Zuma's legal team handed over a medical certificate to prove to the Pietermaritzburg high court that the former president was absent from proceedings only because he was unwell. However, the court found that the sick note “raised more questions”. Here's a list of some of them: The Jacob G Zuma Foundation issued a statement on Monday saying Zuma would not be in court on Tuesday “due to treatment he is receiving from his medical team”. Subsequently, a warrant of arrest was issued for Zuma until his next court date. Mantsha said he was disappointed that the court doubted Zuma's medical certificate.
