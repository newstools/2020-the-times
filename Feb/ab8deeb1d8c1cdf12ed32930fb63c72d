News anchor Xoli Mngambi and his eNCA crew were robbed of their equipment in Mamelodi East, east of Pretoria, on Wednesday afternoon. Three robbers accosted the eNCA team and robbed them of two cameras and a tripod before fleeing in a silver-grey VW Polo with no registration plates. Mngambi said the robbery happened while they were filming a feature segment in the township. He said a case of theft had been opened at the Mamelodi East police station.
