The Zondo commission of inquiry heard on Wednesday that security vetting of SAA senior managers in 2016 was so "personal" there were fears that it was being used to purge opponents of then board chair Dudu Myeni. An affidavit filed to the commission by SAA employee Sharon Olitzki, who was among those Myeni wanted out of the national airline, detailed the nature of the interview segment of the vetting process. Interviews with the 118 affected staff went deep into their family affairs.Â Only senior managers, executives and their support staff were subjected to this vetting process, the commission heard. The process apparently revealed that Olitzki held dual citizenship. The questions asked by State Security Agency (SSA) officials included requests for intimate personal details of interviewees' family members, relationships and lifestyle choices, such as: Other questions attempt to gauge the interviewee's financial habits, moral boundaries and political beliefs, for example:  Asked if these questions were personal, SSA member Nokunqoba Dlamini, who was project manager for the vetting process at SAA, told the commission that the vetting interviews were "always personal". "The entire interview by SAA for vetting is personal in nature," she said. Dlamini also confirmed to the commission that she had met Myeni alone before she had a presentation about the project to the full SAA board. The board meeting was held a day later - after Dlamini had the one-on-one meeting with Myeni, who was absent in the board meeting, she said.
