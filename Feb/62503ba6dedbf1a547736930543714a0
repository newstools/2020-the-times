As Mzansi waits for Cyril Ramaphosa to deliver his Sona on Thursday evening, we take a look at the promises and subsequent realities during the terms of Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma. Five men have led South Africa as a free and democratic nation after the abolishment of apartheid in 1994. All faced a plethora of challenges once in office.

Ramaphosa faces a mammoth task ahead - how will he compare to presidents past?
