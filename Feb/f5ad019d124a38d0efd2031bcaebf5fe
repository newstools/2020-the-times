The song African Dream launched the world record-breaking Match in Africa at Cape Town Stadium on Friday. The Ndlovu Youth Choir, who won global acclaim with their appearances on America's Got Talent last year, performed the song as children from Cape Town's Zip Zap Circus swung on trapezes. A worldwide TV audience and a 50,000-strong record crowd for a tennis match were looking forward to the highlight of the evening, a singles match between event host Roger Federer and world no 2 Rafael Nadal. Sporting celebrities in the crowd included Rugby World Cup-winning Springbok captain John Smit, former Bok winger Bryan Habana and swimmer Ryk Neethling. Former DA leader Mmusi Maimane was also there. The stadium gates opened at 4.30pm, shortly after the world No 3 (Federer) and Nadal finished a practice session on the orange hard-court built over the pitch. Traffic began to build up in the city centre soon after the first roads around the stadium were closed at noon. Fans were asked to be in their seats by 7pm, and the tennis was due to begin 30 minutes later with a half-hour doubles match featuring Federer and Mirosoft founder Bill Gates against Nadal and SA comedian Trevor Noah. Speaking to reporters after practising with Nadal, Federer said Gates and Noah had practised on the court earlier in the day. Federer, who arrived in Cape Town on Wednesday, started his day in the Bo-Kaap before a photo session with Nadal and the players' families on the Grand Parade in central Cape Town. Then the two stars spent time with children from Hangberg Pre-Primary School in Hout Bay at a “learning through play” session at Green Point Athletics Stadium. The Match in Africa benefits Federer's foundation, which in the last 16 years has spent almost R800m on education projects in SA, five other Southern African countries and Switzerland.
