Lawyers for deputy judge president Patricia Goliath have denied that there was anything untoward about her decision not to attend, or send representatives to, Friday’s meeting of the Judicial Service Commission’s Conduct Committee, which will decide whether she or judge president John Hlophe will face a possible impeachment investigation.
