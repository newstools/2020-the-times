Our neighboursâ€™ house burned down last week. A lightning rod and brick chimney still stand defiant above a white garden wall, the remnants of what I imagine was a happy family home. But the thatch roof and everything that was beneath it is ash. Things would have been very different if a fire engine had arrived on time.
