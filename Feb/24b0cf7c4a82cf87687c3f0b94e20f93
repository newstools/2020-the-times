A former SAA chairperson this week told the Zondo commission about Tony Gupta’s alleged attempt to bribe him in late October 2012. Testifying at the Zondo commission Vuyisile Kona alleged he was offered a R500,000 bribe at the family’s Saxonwold compound. The Sunday Times broke the story of the alleged bribe on the front page of the March 17 2013 edition with the headline 'Guptas tried to buy SAA boss'. The Gupta brothers vehemently denied the allegation and gave notice of their intention to sue the newspaper for R500m. Nothing ever came of the legal action. Kona told the commission this week that once he had arrived in Saxonwold his phone was taken away, and he was led to a room. Present were Tony Gupta, Jacob Zuma's son Duduzane Zuma, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule's son Tshepiso Magashule and Siyabonga Mahlangu — then an adviser to former minster of public enterprises Malusi Gigaba. Kona told the commission that Mahlangu had repeatedly insisted that he visit “some people” or “certain stakeholders”. Puzzled by the requests, he said he tried to avoid the subject but eventually relented. “It still haunts me today, I found it strange that an adviser to the minister would call me to an individual's house.” He said he didn’t know of the Guptas at the time. After tea and pleasantries Tony Gupta took R100,000 cash from a drawer and offered it to him, saying, “Before we continue I have to welcome you into the family.” Kona said he refused the money and Gupta then offered him R500,000, which he again refused. “My father always taught me there was no free lunch in this world,” he said. He left the compound shortly afterwards. Kona  told the inquiry his work environment changed after the meeting and at times he started to feel like a “hunted animal”. He was suspended for “spurious reasons” on February 11 2013.
