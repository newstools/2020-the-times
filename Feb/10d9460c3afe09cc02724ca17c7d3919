SA under-23 coach David Notoane has named a huge provisional squad of 78 potential players‚ who will eventually be whittled down to a final 22‚ for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games men’s football tournament. The provisional squad includes a number of names of overage players. The final 22-man squad for the Games‚ which run from July 24 to August 9‚ can include three players over 23. A final squad must be submitted on July 1. Notoane’s squad includes 27 defenders‚ 24 midfielders and 19 strikers. “We have a lot of hard work ahead of us to ensure that we take only the best to represent South Africa at this big stage‚” Notoane said. “This is just a preliminary group of players who we think will be considered for the tournament‚ and as you can see it includes youngsters and seniors. “The next few weeks will be very crucial as we will be running the rule over the players we believe will be best suited for this competition. It is a lovely headache to have because all the players on the list are good quality‚ but unfortunately we can’t take all of them. “We are confident that the group we will choose will do the business for the country‚ but for now we are monitoring all of them to see if they can make the final squad.” The overage players in the squad include Bafana Bafana goalkeepers Ronwen Williams and Darren Keet. Bafana captain Thulani Hlatshwayo and left-back Innocent Maela are among the defenders.
