Wax statues of former president Nelson Mandela and struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela have received the thumbs up on social media. The statues were placed at Nelson Mandela Square in Sandton on Thursday. The statues were first unveiled at a pop-up museum in Durban last year by sculptor Lungelo Gumede. On social media, many were impressed by how realistic the statue of Madikizela-Mandela was compared to her ex-husband's, but the placement of the statues sparked debate online. In 2018, TimesLIVE reported that Madikizela-Mandela insisted that if a statue were to be erected in her honour it should be in Soweto, not Sandton. Three years before her death in Aprilâ€š Madikizela-Mandela said she had already identified a spot next to her home in Orlando West where a statue would stand. Here is a snapshot of some of the reactions.
