A funeral service for 13-year-old Enoch Mpianzi was held at Kensington Secondary School in Johannesburg. The former Parktown Boys' High School pupil died last month during a school orientation camp at the Nyati Bush and Riverbreak lodge near Brits. Mpianzi's death has brought into sharp focus a glaring lack of safety measures at adventure camps, which are not regulated. About a week ago, Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi suspended the school's principal, Malcolm Williams. Over the next few weeks, the Mpianzi family will be consulting with legal representatives — paid for by the EFF — over what is likely going to be a civil claim against the school and education department for alleged negligence.
