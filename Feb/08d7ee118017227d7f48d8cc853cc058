The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) student representative council (SRC) says it's not its place to question or investigate where the money Duduzane Zuma donated to students comes from. This after the public, including the former minister and ANC national executive committee (NEC) member Derek Hanekom, questioned the source of the “undisclosed amount”. Speaking to TimesLIVE on Wednesday, UKZN SRC president Sifiso Simelane said it was "in communication with people from Duduzane's office". "We will be releasing a statement and holding a press briefing once we have sorted everything out," he said. When asked  if Duduzane had confirmed that he would offer students financial assistance, Simelane responded: “Duduzane confirmed that he will help UKZN students in whatever way possible, one of the needs of students is financial assistance.” Simelane said he was in possession of a full video in which Duduzane confirms that he would come to the financial rescue of UKZN students. IOL reported that the former president's son pledged the “undisclosed amount” of money to assist students after receiving letters asking for financial assistance. In a viral video, Zuma can be heard pleading with the students to stop burning buildings “To my good brothers at UKZN, let’s stop burning our buildings. We’re smarter than this. I understand your frustrations, I understand your anger. “Let’s channel our frustrations, let’s hone in on our anger and let’s make a difference. We will sit down, I will come to you and we will do what needs to be done,” said Zuma.
