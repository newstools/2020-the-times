Parents who expect celebrities to set a good example for their children should think again as influencer Mihlali Ndamase has made it clear she's not here for any of that and definitely won't make it on that list. While a lot of young people  look up to famous people and sometimes copy their lifestyles, the influencer has hit back at parents who put unnecessary pressure on celebs, forgetting who needed to take full accountability for their children's behaviour. Mihlali's gatvol revelation comes after a young Twitter exchange with a tweep who criticised her for tweeting that she believed in a man more than she believed in herself. With the tweep calling out Mihlali for being a "bad" role model to the younger generation, the YouTube sensation hit back, saying, "Khayophangela", simply telling the tweep to "Go to work" as she felt her initial tweet was nothing but her being sarcastic. As her clap back sparked a conversation about why parents expect a lot from celebs, Mihlali then fired another shot, claiming  parents who do that don’t give their children enough to look up to. ".Then you come on the internet and police people’s behavior so they can do your job for you," Mihlali said while reiterating that people who get pressed over her tweets were nothing but "dumb".
