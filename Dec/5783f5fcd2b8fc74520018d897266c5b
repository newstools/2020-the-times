Roche said on Friday it launched a laboratory SARS-CoV-2 antigen Test to support high-volume testing of suspected Covid-19 patients, as very high demand for tests prompts the Swiss drugmaker to offer new options to the market. The Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 antigen Test is an automated laboratory assay intended as an aid in diagnosis of active SARS-CoV-2 infection, Roche said in a statement. Roche said it would be able to ramp up to a double-digit million number of tests per month by early 2021. It said the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test showed a 94.5% sensitivity across 200 PCR confirmed symptomatic individuals and a 99.9% specificity across 2,747 PCR negative symptomatic and screening individuals. Roche has also filed for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration.
