Mamelodi Sundowns defender Motjeka Madisha's reported death took a bizarre twist on Tuesday afternoon when the Chloorkop club asked the Premier Soccer League (PSL) not to observe a moment of silence when the club faces TS Galaxy in a league match on Tuesday night. A moment of silence would have been observed a few minutes before kickoff at Loftus — as is tradition after a player has died — but the PSL stunned the nation when they said the  police are investigating certain issues‚ and therefore the solemn gesture would not be observed. Sundowns have asked the PSL not observe a moment of silence in all the matches that will be played on Tuesday and  Wednesday. This latest development follows Sundowns' announcement that Madisha's family met  pathologists on Monday to establish if the person who died in a horrific car crash while behind the wheel of the vehicle in Kempton Park in the early hours of Sunday morning was indeed their son. The 25-year-old from Ga-Madisha village in Zebediela, Limpopo, reportedly died when the vehicle  crashed into a steel pole in wet conditions and burst into flames near Kempton Park. The accident happened just after midnight. Madisha’s sports car caught fire on Zuurfontein road, near Sundowns' training base in Chloorkop. It is not clear whether Madisha was driving the vehicle  as one person was thrown out while the other one was trapped inside the burning car. The passenger who was ejected from the vehicle also suffered fatal burn wounds.
