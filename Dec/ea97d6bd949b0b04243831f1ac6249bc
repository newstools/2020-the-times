RIP Gee Six Five,” she wrote in a short statement on social media. No further details about her death had been made public at the time of publishing this article. Gee Six Five became an internet sensation last month when her song was shared online and soon went viral. Fans dubbed the song “a December hit” and helped it top the SA iTunes music charts,  and Idols SA judge Somizi said  he would love to work with her. Speaking  about her newfound fame, she told Trending SA  she wanted to share a message about jealousy. “When I composed this song, I wanted to address a question that people are always thinking: 'Who are these people talking about me?' You know, who are these jealous people, who are these people laughing at me? So I wanted to send a message,” Gee Six Five said. She recently received her Masters and was working towards her PhD at the time of her passing. Friends, family and fans, including Duduzane Zuma and actress Nelisiwe Sibiya, have flooded social media with tributes to the star and messages of condolences to her family.
