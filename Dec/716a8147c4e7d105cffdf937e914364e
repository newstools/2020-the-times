The Western Cape saw a jump in new Covid-19 cases with 1,732 recorded. There were 1,447 in the Eastern Cape.

The latest figures come as a doctor in KwaZulu-Natal urged teenagers who attended matric rage parties to quarantine after an influx of Covid-19 test requests in the province. Dr Kamz Govender, who works in the Upper Highway area west of Durban, said the number of requests for Covid-19 tests in the past 48 hours had been overwhelming. Govender wrote on Facebook: “This has been largely due to them attending the annual matric rage event over the last week and having multiple friends who have tested positive for Covid-19.” He and his team had noted that 95% of teenagers who tested were positive for Covid-19 but almost all were asymptomatic.
