Police officers descended on the streets of Johannesburg on Tuesday evening, enforcing new lockdown regulations. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the country's move to level 3 lockdown on Monday evening. Under the new regulations, the curfew is extended  from 9pm to 6am. The sale and distribution of alcohol is prohibited. In an address in KwaMashu, KwaZulu-Natal, earlier on Wednesday, police minister Bheki Cele urged officers to be vigilant in policing regulations. "It has become a crime to undermine the protocols of Covid-19," he said. Offenders could face fines or imprisonment if found to be contravening regulations. TimesLIVE
