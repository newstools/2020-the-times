In 2020 the world marked 100 years of radio, and in 2021 The Radio Awards look to celebrate the next century by shining a spotlight on the enduring value of radio in SA. Entries for The Radio Awards 2021 have opened. Entries close on February 5 2021, and the winners’ announcement will be streamed online on May 14 2021. The Radio Awards has honoured outstanding achievements in the radio industry for the past 10 years, setting benchmarks for all stations and professionals to strive towards. In 2020, The Radio Awards attracted a record number of more than 2,000 entries from more than 160 stations. Head of Arena Events Taryn Westoby, which hosts The Radio Awards, believes that the role of radio has never been more important in the lives of South Africans. “The country has faced a tough year marked by the Covid-19 pandemic, where radio has provided a necessary lifeline for millions during lockdown. Radio has played a vital role in keeping people informed and in touch, emphasising again that it’s an essential form of entertainment, communication and connection for South Africans.” To support the radio industry during 2020, The Radio Awards programme was extended to include a “Tune In” series of virtual dialogues that will continue into 2021. The online dialogues will focus on various topics of interest for radio broadcasters and marketers, allowing people across the country to learn from experts while maintaining social distancing.
