More than 3,000 excess deaths were recorded in the past week, the SA Medical Research Council has revealed in its latest statistical release. This, the medical body said, was a reflection of the “impact of a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic”. “The weekly number of deaths of people aged one year and older has increased in the week of December 9-15, reflecting the impact of a second wave of the pandemic,” the SAMRC said. “There were 12,014 deaths from all causes in the most recent week. The weekly number of deaths from natural causes increased in the week of December 9-15. “In the past week, there were 3,085 excess natural deaths of people of 1+ years, a jump  from the 2,397 estimated for the previous week and the 1,114 for the week before that (indicating an exponential increase in deaths).” In particular, the  increase in deaths was noticeable among people aged 60  and older. On December 9, the health ministry said that 23,661 Covid-19 deaths had officially been recorded. The official death toll has since increased to 25,246 as of Tuesday December 22. “During the period May 6 to December 15, there have been 59,463 excess deaths from natural causes of people 1+ years old when using the revised base accounting for lower mortality during lockdown,” the SAMRC said. In particular, the  council said  deaths from natural causes in the Eastern Cape were on the increase, with 1,766 excess natural deaths experienced between December 9 and 15. “This number exceeds the number of excess deaths experienced at the height of the first Covid-19 surge in the province,”  it said.
