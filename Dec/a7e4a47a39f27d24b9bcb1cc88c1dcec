Sorry SA, Siv Ngesi isn't our next Magic Mike or Chippendales recruit. This week the actor and comedian took up pole-dancing lessons, leading many to think he might be preparing for his next film or a side hustle as a stripper. But Ngesi, 35, said the motive behind his pole-dancing and pink manicured nails ran much deeper. "I'm on an incredible, huge journey of re-imaging and re-evaluating my masculinity. The current definition of masculinity is definitely failing us. A lot of us are talking about what's wrong. Masculinity and toxic masculinity is a problem." Ngesi said he also wanted to challenge himself to try something new, outside his comfort zone. He had a little girl paint his nails pink and he took a ballet class wearing tights and a pink tutu, all in pursuit of challenging the current status quo and preconceived notions of masculinity. The avid boxer said pole-dancing was one of the most difficult physical things he has ever done. "With pole-dancing you have to stay in the air and still look sexy and graceful and composed. A lot of people like to make fun of ballet and pole-dancing, they don't realise it's a sport and it's difficult. They don't realise that most of the stuff that women do up there is difficult and men could never do." Ngesi said he has been on a personal journey to redefine masculinity for years. "During lockdown I did a lot of baking and people were surprised. But I can out-bake some people's grandmothers, my souffl√© is incredible, my lemon meringue is to die for and my red velvet cake is pretty orgasmic." He added that he is not done challenging the status quo. Next he'll take on salsa lessons, followed by drag. "This is not me coming out of the closet. This is me, I love trying new things - and even if it was me coming out of the closet, who gives a f**k?"
