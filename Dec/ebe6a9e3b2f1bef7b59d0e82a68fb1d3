EFF leader Julius Malema has responded to mounting calls about having a political debate with businessman Duduzane Zuma, saying his son was ready to debate with Zuma. The calls were made over the weekend after videos of Zuma went viral. Many suggested  Zuma and Malema had  things in common after going viral, saying they would like to see the two debate politics. However, Malema hinted  the debate would be beneath him. He said he had already debated with the businessman's father, former president Jacob Zuma. “Ratanang is ready to debate him; I debated his father,” said Malema. The response drew mixed feelings, with many saying Zuma would win the debate because of his intelligence. Others said Malema had what it takes to win because of his skills and experience.
