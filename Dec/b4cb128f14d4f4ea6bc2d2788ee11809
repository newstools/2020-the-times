A man working for a company contracted to print examination papers has been arrested in connection with the leaking of the matric maths exam paper 2. The question paper was widely circulated in some  provinces just before the exam was due to be written. The Hawks confirmed on Tuesday that Themba Daniel Shikwambana, 31, was arrested last Wednesday following an investigation into the leaking of the question paper. Col Katlego Mogale confirmed that Shikwambana was employed at a Johannesburg-based company  contracted by the department of basic education to print the 2020 matric exam papers. "The accused  appeared before the Johannesburg magistrate’s court on Thursday. An investigation into the leakage of other papers is  continuing," said Mogale. Shikwambana was  released on bail and the case was postponed until January 27 2021. Education department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said  the council of education ministers held a special meeting on Tuesday to receive a preliminary report into the leaking of matric exam papers. The council "deliberated on the report and noted the investigation had not  been completed and  more work  needed to be done". The council acknowledged the "complex nature of the investigation" and thanked the Hawks for assisting. Motshekga was expected to host a media briefing  later this week after assessing the report.
