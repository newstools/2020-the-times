Three people were injured  in an “explosion” at a Germiston factory on Wednesday afternoon, paramedic service ER24 said. Earlier, ER24's Ineke van Huyssteen said that paramedics arrived about  3pm and found a patient with fatal injuries. However, in a later release, she said: "No fatalities on the scene as reported earlier. Unfortunately, we made a mistake in our earlier press release." A medical helicopter was used to airlift two of the injured to hospital, while the third was taken for treatment via ambulance. TimesLIVE
