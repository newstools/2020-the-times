The National Lotteries Commission (NLC) is trending on social media after an  investigation into allegations of fraud and maladministration. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) on Tuesday confirmed  it had been granted a search warrant on Monday to raid the offices of the NLC. SIU spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago told TimesLIVE: “We are asked, through allegations, to investigate malpractice and maladministration at the commission.” The allegations  include “unlawful, irregular or unapproved acquisitive acts, transactions, measures or practices having a bearing upon state property, and intentional or negligent loss of public money or damage to public property”. The Sunday Times recently reported that under investigation by the SIU is a project by a charity organisation, I Am Made for God's Glory, which received more than R11m in funding from the NLC after it promised to build a cricket pitch, tennis courts, soccer and rugby fields and volleyball and basketball courts in Thohoyandou, Limpopo. Community member Amos Mafumo told the publication the organisation only painted the grandstand, which was built in 2014. He said the organisation painted and left without paying workers. He said the community doesn't know the organisation and the stadium hasn't been used in years. On Twitter, many have welcomed the investigation and called on the SIU to ensure accountability for implicated individuals. The National Lotteries Commission oversees the disbursement of funds to charities who benefit from the nation's lotteries, while ithuba runs the lotto draws. The SIU are investigating the National Lotteries Commission and not ithuba. However, some Twitter users still jokingly questioned whether there would be an in investigation into the recent odd winning sequence of lotto numbers. Here are some of the reactions:
