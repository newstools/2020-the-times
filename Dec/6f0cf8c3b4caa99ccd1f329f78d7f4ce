And as usual, the critics also jumped in there for some balance. Check out the reactions below: This isn't the first time the star has come to the TL with some financial advice for his fans who need a little guidance. In these Covid-19 stricken times, the star said we shouldn't feel ashamed to downgrade. Even if it's two steps forward and one step back, hard work will guide you back to financial success, he suggested. “I’ve learnt that downgrading isn’t the end of the world.

My prayers go out to those who have suffered the humiliation and stress,” tweeted Prince Kaybee.
