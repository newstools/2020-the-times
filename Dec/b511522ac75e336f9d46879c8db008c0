The choir also teamed up with Netflix for a festive song titled Square Root of Possible from the streaming service's holiday film Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Adventure. The song is from an American-style theatrical piece and was transformed to add an “African feel”. It is sung in six official SA languages, namely English, Setswana, Sesotho, isiZulu, isiNdebele and sePedi. The choir also teamed up with US singer Pink for the latest rendition of A Million Dreams as part of a Unicef Changemaker 2020 fund-raiser. “It was an honour to collaborate with the Ndlovu Youth Choir on this new version of A Million Dreams. Though we were thousands of miles apart due to the pandemic, we were connected by Unicef’s life-saving mission of putting children first,” said Pink.
