Embattled power utility Eskom will be paid back nearly  R1.6bn  by construction contractor ABB for “over-payments” on contracts. Special Investigating Unit (SIU) head Andy Mothibi announced that  ABB had come to an agreement with the power utility during a joint conference on Friday afternoon. According to Mothibi, an internal investigation by ABB indicated that corrupt practices were present in the awarding of a multimillion-rand tender . The investigations into the irregular awarding of ABB’s tender and corruption involved foreign  agencies, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the US department of justice and the  FBI. The SIU has said those possibly involved in the corruption have been identified and  will face legal consequences. TimesLIVE
