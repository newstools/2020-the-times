Christmas under lockdown for UK as new variant of Covid-19 surges Prime minister Boris Johnson has imposed an effective lockdown on almost 18 million people in England and reversed plans to ease curbs over Christmas, saying Britain was dealing with a new coronavirus strain that is up to 70% more transmissible than the original.
