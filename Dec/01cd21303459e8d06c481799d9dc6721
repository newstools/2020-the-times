Ithuba has announced  20 people have won the R114m PowerBall jackpot and one person won the R5.8m PowerBall PLUS jackpot in Tuesday’s draws. Having  20 jackpot winners in one is, according to Ithuba, a “historical occasion” as it has never happened before. “While there  have been multiple jackpot winners from the same draw before, including the R110m Lotto jackpot  shared by four people in January 2018, never has there  been 21 jackpot winners in one night,” the company said. The sequence of the winning numbers was 5,6,7,8,9 and 10 for the bonus number, something Ithuba said was a common sequence in lotteries worldwide. “History and experience have taught us it is common for multiple players to select the same winning numbers,” said Busisiwe Msizi, head of corporate relations at the lotteries operator. “A week ago, we celebrated two players who won the R19m PowerBall PLUS jackpot in the  November 24 draw. “What we were not imagining was 20 people could win the same jackpot. This came as a pleasant surprise to us, and  our wildest dream came true. It has always been Ithuba’s goal to offer life-changing jackpots to as many people as possible - especially now, following the tough year  we’ve had.” One winner in the PowerBall draw played via an Absa App. Other winners were in: The PowerBall PLUS winner played via the FNB App. “We encourage players from these areas to  check their tickets and to come collect their winnings. There is no doubt  this will positively impact the lives of the winners and their loved ones,” said Msizi. “We take this opportunity to congratulate everyone, not only for winning the jackpots, but also for being a part of  National Lottery history.” TimesLIVE
