Israel will receive an initial shipment of Pfizer Inc coronavirus vaccines on Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said, a day earlier than first announced. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech last month agreed to provide Israel with 8 million doses of the vaccine, which Britain became the first country to administer on Tuesday. One of the SA health experts involved in the fight against Covid-19, Prof Salim Abdool Karim, has lamented the impact of super-spreading events like the recent 2020 Ballito Rage Festival, saying if the organisers are found to have broken the rules they should be legally charged. This comes after close to 100 Covid-19  infections have been linked to the Ballito Rage festivities. The event took place from November 27 to December 4 in KwaZulu-Natal. Several other editions of the annual party have either been cancelled or postponed. The United Arab Emirates health ministry said on Wednesday an interim analysis of in-country Phase III clinical trials of Sinopharm's Covid-19 vaccine has 86% efficacy against the infection. It also said it had registered the vaccine, for which it approved emergency use in September for certain groups.
