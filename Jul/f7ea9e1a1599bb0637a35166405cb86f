A 25-year-old North West teacher has been found dead in her home, the provincial department of education said. Education spokesperson Elias Malindi said the woman was allegedly strangled on Monday  at a village near Rustenburg. Malindi said due to sensitivity around the matter, the family have asked that her name not be made public. The teacher was originally from a village near Mafikeng. She obtained her degree in 2018 from the North West University, Mafikeng campus, and started teaching life science at a secondary school last year. Provincial education MEC Mmaphefo Matsemela said she was saddened by the murder, saying it was “one death too many”. “As a department we are fighting a common enemy called Covid-19, and we do not expect to lose our teachers in this way. "It is heartbreaking to lose a young teacher who could have had a long career. "Teachers play an important role of moulding the future of our country, and as a society we need to take good care of them and protect them. “A nation without teachers is a doomed society. Teachers are a light to the community. I am appealing to the police to arrest the perpetrators of this heinous act. They should rot in jail,” Matsemela said. The MEC is expected to visit the teacher's family  on Thursday.
