North West premier Job Mokgoro has gone into “voluntary quarantine” at a provincial hospital after testing positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. His spokesperson Vuyisile Ngesi told TimesLIVE on Wednesday that Mokgoro made the decision on Wednesday morning. “He left early this morning with the security guys. They didn't even tell us where they were going. Only he and his personal security detail know where he is,” he said. “The premier decided to go into voluntary quarantine at a hospital because he stays at an official residence and has a lot of people who work there. “It was precautionary — for his safety and the safety of the people who are part of his domestic team, like gardeners and helpers.” Ngesi said another concern was the number of people who visit the residence. “There was traffic there. They wanted to come and pass their regards on. There were people at the entrance.” Ngesi was adamant that Mokgoro was well, saying that about 30 minutes before speaking to TimesLIVE at around 6.30pm on Wednesday, the premier had been conducting a live radio interview. His only symptom was a slight cough and his condition had not deteriorated. “He was in good spirits,” he added.
