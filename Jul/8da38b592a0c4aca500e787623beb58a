Local municipality chief whip and ANC councillor Lindelwa Penisi is facing disciplinary action after she hurled vulgar insults at community members in Raymond Mhlaba municipality. The insults were captured on a video widely circulated on social media. In the video, an agitated Penisi can be seen pointing fingers and apparently shouting “f-off, Matatiele boy. Go get circumcised first. Voetsek”. She goes on to say: “Call all of them, those who voted for me. I don’t care. I am not scared of them.” One person in the background asks: “So you are insulting all of us?" Penisi responds, “Yes I am.” A man replies: “I am recording. I will make you famous.” The ANC in the province has since recalled Penisi, according to provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukaithobi. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this un-ANC behaviour. It will never be tolerated. Disciplinary processes will be instituted against councillor Penisi,” she said. “Such abhorrent behaviour makes a complete mockery of the office she holds and is contemptuous to the people of Raymond Mhlaba and the constituency she represents. We will at all times defend our people’s hard-won democracy and protect it against those who are clearly working relentlessly to undermine it,” said Ngcukaithobi. © TimesLIVE
