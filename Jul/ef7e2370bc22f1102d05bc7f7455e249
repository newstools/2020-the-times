While most of Mzansi is still finding it hard to let go of her Scandal! character YV, actress Kgomotso Christopher has already moved on to the next chapter, which includes being aÂ  lead in an upcoming drama and a TV presenting gig on a baby talk show. Kgomotso took to Instagram to share that joining the presenters of SABC2 baby-themed show Raising Babies 101 was a dream come true. She explained that she had prayed for such a gig over a decade ago. "Dreams delayed... are not dreams denied," Kgomotso began. "Ten years ago, I was a mom of two toddlers and was a guest on a baby show on TV... soon after that interview, I added (that) to my vision list, (with) the hope that I would one day host a similar show... So (I am) so honoured and excited to join the Raising Babies 101 family... Thank you for making my dreams come true!" Kgomotso's edition, The Toddlers Edition, plays every Tuesday, 9am on SABC2. Check some behind the scenes videos below. Kgomotso has shared her excitement to have a gig where she isn't playing a character on screen and her fans are happy to finally know the person behind the characters she's brought to life brilliantly on the small screen. With her loyal fanbase following her everywhere like the queen she is, Kgomotso enjoyed a great first show as her fans showered her with love.
