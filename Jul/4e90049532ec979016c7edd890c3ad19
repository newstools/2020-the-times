When President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation on Thursday night about the impact of Covid-19, EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi  also had the attention of South Africans through social media. Ndlozi was vocal about the closure of schools  to help curb the spread of the coronavirus, and about investigating corruption relating to the Covid-19 economic and social relief packages. Ramaphosa said public schools will close for four weeks, a decision taken by cabinet after  meetings with education stakeholders and experts. Schools will close untilÂ  August 24, but  grade 12 pupils and teachers  will  returnon August 3. In response, Ndlozi questioned the scientific evidence on which the decision was made, saying one week is not enough to slow the spread of Covid-19. In another tweet, he said closing schools while most economic activity is open will make no significant difference in the fight against Covid-19. On corruption, the president said a special investigating unit, which comprises the police,  the National Prosecuting Authority  and Hawks officials, will investigate the mismanagement of Covid-19 social relief funds. Ndlozi claimed  the R500bn  allocated to  help businesses and individuals affected by Covid-19  had already  been depleted by corrupt officials. Ndlozi soon trended at number one.
