Evidence and testimony presented at the state capture inquiry can now be accessed by law-enforcement agencies. In a gazette published on Tuesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa effected the change, which potentially opens greater chances of prosecution. The gazette, which changes the terms of the inquiry into allegations of state capture, states that any employee of the inquiry will not be  precluded from being employed or used as a consultant for “any” state prosecution agency. They are also allowed to use or disclose any “information, records or documents” obtained during work with the inquiry as part of law-enforcement investigations. © TimesLIVE
