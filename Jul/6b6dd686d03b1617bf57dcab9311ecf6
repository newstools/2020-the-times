A 38-year-old Northern Cape man has been arrested on a charge of human trafficking, police said on Wednesday. The arrest comes after the Hawks received information about a 26-year-old woman who was allegedly trafficked from Pietermarizburg in KwaZulu-Natal last month. “It is claimed that the victim was allegedly locked up at a house, raped and repeatedly assaulted by the perpetrator,” said Capt Nomthandazo Mnisi. A joint operation by the Hawks and Kimberley police led to the arrest of the man. He is expected to appear in the Kimberley magistrate's court on Friday. © TimesLIVE
