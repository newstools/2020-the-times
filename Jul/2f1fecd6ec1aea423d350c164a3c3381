South Africa has recorded 10,144 new Covid-19 infections - 4,597 of these in Gauteng.

Of these deaths, 75 were in Gauteng, 44 in the Western Cape, 36 in the Eastern Cape, 22 in KwaZulu-Natal and 15 in Limpopo. The good news is that a positive milestone has been hit - there are now more than 100,000 people who have recovered from the respiratory illness, which is caused by the coronavirus. "The number of recoveries is 102,299 which translates to a recovery rate of 47.4%," the ministry said. In terms of the number of cases, Gauteng is now just 668 cases behind the Western Cape, which has long been the country's virus epicentre.
