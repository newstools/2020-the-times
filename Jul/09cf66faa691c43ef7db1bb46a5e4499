South Africans are mourning the loss of veteran actress Mary Twala who died on Saturday, aged 80. Her son, Somizi Mhlongo, confirmed the news on social media, saying “the tree has fallen. I'm shattered to the core.” Twala died at Netcare Park Lane Private Hospital. “Today's my late father's birthday and my mom decided to respond to his call to join him in heaven. The tree has fallen. I'm shattered to the core but I'd be very selfish if I don't release her," wrote Somizi on Instagram. Twala's career as a stage and film actress spans six decades. She became a household name after starring in Sarafina!, Deliwe and Taxi to Soweto. Her role in the entertainment industry was recognised in 2019, when she received the Order of Ikhamanga from president Cyril Ramaphosa. On social media, #RIPMaryTwala trended as news of the iconic actress's death broke.
