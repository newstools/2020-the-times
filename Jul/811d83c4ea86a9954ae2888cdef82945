Chippa United have confirmed the appointment of former Bloemfontein Celtic mentor Lehlohonolo Seema as the team's new head coach. Last week the Eastern Cape-based football club was left without a coach after deciding against renewing Rulani Mokwenaâ€™s contract. Mokwena was loaned to Chippa by Orlando Pirates to help the team finish the season after the sudden resignation of Norman Mapeza in March.
