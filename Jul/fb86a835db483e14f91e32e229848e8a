UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres will deliver the 18th annual Nelson Mandela lecture on Saturday. This will be the first time the event is being held virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Guterres is expected to touch on the pandemic, inequality as well as the life of Mandela's daughter, Zindzi, who was buried in Johannesburg on Friday.
