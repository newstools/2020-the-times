At least two schools are set to defy the suspension of classes and are preparing to open in two weeks. President Cyril Ramaphosa this week said all state schools would close until August 24, except matrics and grades 7s. The defiance is likely to widen the divide between rich and poor schools, according to one official. An apparent jump of 400 Covid-19 deaths in a single day in the Eastern Cape this week has sparked finger-pointing as scapegoats are sought for the reporting "glitch". The sudden rise from 945 on Tuesday to 1,345 on Wednesday came after the Nelson Mandela Bay region failed to report deaths between June 29 and July 21. By Friday the province had recorded 71,338 Covid-19 cases and 1,406 deaths. When she tested positive for Covid-19, Durban pilot Fathima Khan Gabie had a mini hospital ward set up in her home, with care from a nurse, doctors and a psychologist. Khan, who is CEO of her own flight school, was relieved not to have to go to hospital when she suffered breathing problems, temperature spikes and dizziness. Overcrowded wards and overwhelmed health-care professionals have prompted some private doctors to create Covid-19 “wards” in patients’ homes.
