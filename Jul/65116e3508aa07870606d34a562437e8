DJ Black Coffee had the streets crying for an end to the nationwide lockdown, when a video of him performing a set on the Greek island of Mykonos went viral on Twitter. The 90-minute sunset show was held at Scorpios on the island on Tuesday evening and was streamed across the world on YouTube and social media. It also featured DJ Angelo and Themba. Snippets of his set were posted to Twitter, and shared widely. The gig comes just days after Black Coffee and Themba resumed their world tours with a performance in the French Riviera. The pair are also set to perform in Riccione, Italy, this weekend. Mzansi has been cooped up for  months, with no groove in sight. So fans were feeling all the chest pains when they heard that Black Coffee was out there making the rest of the world dance. They tuned in to try catch the vibe but were breathing through the wound and flooded Twitter with messages praising Black Coffee and asking president Cyril Ramaphosa to let them out to party.
