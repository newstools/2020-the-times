The term “entanglement” has been trending on Twitter since Saturday, thanks to actress Jada Pinkett-Smith’s interview on the Red Table Talk with her husband, Will Smith. The Girls Trip star took herself to the table to address claims  by singer August Alsina that they had a brief romantic relationship with Will’s “permission”. Jada admitted that she did date August “about four-and-a-half years ago” when she and Will were separated. “We were over. From there, as time went on I got into a different kind of entanglement with August.” Will asked her to be clear about “entanglement”. “I think you need to say clearly what happened [as far as] you and I deciding we were going to take our space and what happened? An entanglement? A relationship.” “Yes, a relationship, absolutely,” responded Jada, who said she was in a bad place at the time of the relationship. Like Gwyneth Paltrow coined “uncoupling” when she split from husband Chris Martin, Jada and her “entanglement” were the talk of Twitter.
