Finance minister Tito Mboweni's recent statement on corruption in government has prompted responses from many, including former public protector Thuli Madonsela and former Gauteng premier Mbhazima Shilowa. Mboweni expressed his opinion regarding the stolen Covid-19 relief funds, asking what kind of “unscrupulous thieves” would steal during a pandemic. His statement comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced last week that the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) would be investigating dozens of companies and individuals who are believed to have benefited from dodgy Covid-19 tenders. In a series of tweets, Mboweni slammed corrupt business and government officials and called for those using the Covid-19 pandemic as an opportunity to loot and steal to be punished. “The wrongs being done by unscrupulous thieves must be dealt with decisively. It is time that leadership led without fear, favour or prejudice. Watch the space,” he said. Mboweni also warned that it was “game over” for “Covidpreneurs” who used tenders as a blank cheque to deceive and steal. Weighing in on Mboweni's statement, Shilowa said  talk was “cheap”. “Talk is cheap. You are the government. You said during the election campaign there will be no impunity,” said Shilowa. “You knew people stole funeral money, food parcels and from projects such as the one in Muyexe. You put no steps to stop it. What made you think they won't eat now?” Chiming in, Madonsela echoed Shilowa's statement, saying Mboweni must take action to stop the rot with immediate effect. “Give the SIU and Asset Forfeiture Unit additional resources to act swiftly to prevent cold cases and to get back any public funds misappropriated in the name of Covid-19,” she said.
