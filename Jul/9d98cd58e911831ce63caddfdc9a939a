Of the 345 schools affected by Covid-19 in the province, 236 had returned to full operation while 70 were expected to resume on Monday, coinciding with the planned return of grade 11 and 6 pupils. “The 39 schools that reported positive cases on July 2 and 3 are expected to return to normal by not later than Wednesday.
