Socialite Zodwa Wabantu recently took a five-hour drive to Lusikisiki in the Eastern Cape to clear her mind. Despite the winter weather, she posted a video on Instagram of herself bathing in a bikini in a chilly river. In the video she is seen washing herself with cold water using a rag and a bar of soap. She proudly shouts: “You can’t be free as I am!” It's not the first time that Zodwa's snaps from rural Mzansi have got tongues wagging. She recently faced criticism for posting a picture on Instagram of her by a pit toilet. Some users were not impressed and claimed it was insulting to poor people. Responding to a follower, she wrote: “Where is a joke here? That’s a toilet for us, abantu. So we shouldn’t show our real lives? We turn a blind eye to such but here I am living it. You are sensitive to it."
