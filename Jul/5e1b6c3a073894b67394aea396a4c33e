The Federation of Governing Bodies of SA Schools (Fedsas) says it is awaiting further directions from basic education minister Angie Motshekga on the amended school calendar  before taking any action. After President Cyril Ramaphosa's address on Thursday, stating that all public schools will close until August 24, except matrics and grade 7s, some schools have stated that the school calendar issued by Motshekga on June 7 gives them a right to phase in grades earlier than anticipated. Basic education department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga told the Sunday Times that an amended school calendar would be published soon. Fedsas CEO Paul Colditz said the federation had no plans to make any legal challenge at this stage and said  it would wait for Motshekga to issue new directives before deciding on what action to take. “Maybe the new directives to be issued is what we want so that there will be no need to go to court. “What we want is that communities should be able to decide for themselves when children must return, as it is presently in the existing directives,” Colditz said. He said many schools have taken the option which allows them to seek permission to phase in grades earlier than stipulated by the department. “It is in the interests of learners who cannot learn online to be back in schools. If it is safe for children  to return, they should,” Colditz said © TimesLIVE
