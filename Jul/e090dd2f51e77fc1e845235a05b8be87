When given the choice, most employers who have had to make tough financial decisions amid the coronavirus pandemic have chosen pay cuts over retrenchments. This is according to a survey by remuneration and HR consultancy 21st Century. “Where there is financial pressure and crisis management, a large percentage of respondents said they were reducing pay as a preferred choice to avoid retrenchments. There has also been a marked escalation in increase freezes, compared to previous years,” it said. The company said these findings were based on a series of studies it conducted, aimed at understanding changes in the workplace since the start of the outbreak.
