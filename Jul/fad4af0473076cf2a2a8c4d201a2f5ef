Since hardly anyone is allowed to go anywhere at the moment, Xbox is replacing the games convention demo experience with a Summer Game Fest demo event that will let you get hands-on with over 60 new game demos. Running for a week, from 21 to 27 July, the Summer Game Fest demo event is hoping to replicate the experience of attending a big convention, like E3 or PAX,  by letting anyone with an Xbox One try out a bunch of upcoming games without having to deal with queues, plane tickets and budgetary/plague concerns related to international travel. So, for that week, you’ll be able to find more than 60 (and potentially up to 100) free demos on a special Game Fest Demo tile on the Xbox One Dashboard. There’s just one thing that Xbox’s senior product marketing manager Glenn Gregory wants you to know: many of the demos will be very early in the game’s development and won’t necessarily represent the finished product. As a very tiny taste of what to expect, the event will include demos for Cris Tales, Destroy All Humans!, Haven, Hellpoint, Skatebird, The Vale: Shadow of the Crown, Raji: An Ancient Epic, and Welcome to Elk. Once the event is over, the demos will disappear back into the ether — so be sure to check them out while you can. And if you thought something was awesome, or if it really wasn’t, let the developers know (in a constructive manner). Summer Game Fest is a an industry-wide, digital celebration of video games, featuring events by a variety of publishers, due to the cancellation of all physical conventions. It’s running until August 2020.
