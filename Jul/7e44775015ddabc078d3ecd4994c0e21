President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Sunday night that SA would not go back to a hard lockdown. Speaking during a national address, Ramaphosa said that going back to a level 4 or level 5 lockdown "would not necessarily achieve a significantÂ reduction in the rate of transmission". Also, he said, this could "come at a great and extraordinary economic cost, putting more livelihoods at risk and potentially causing long lasting social harm". "Cabinet has decided that the country will remain at alert level 3 at this stage, but that we should however strengthen the enforcement of existing regulations," he said.
