ANC treasurer-general Paul Mashatile has gone into self-quarantine after a member of staff in his office tested positive for Covid-19. The ANC announced on Monday that Mashatile will observe a 14-day quarantine to enable him and his family members to monitor his health and in compliance with the Covid-19 regulations. This comes a day after Mashatile lost his wife Manzi Ellen  on Sunday after a long illness.  Mashatile  buried his mother Mirriam last week. The ANC said Mashatile's self-quarantine will therefore run parallel to the mourning period. “Family members have been identified, who will have minimal contact with people who will visit the family,” the party said in a statement. The ANC urged the public to  give Mashatile and his family  space and privacy.
