When you own a home, there are often big projects that come up that you avoid but that are necessary to maintain your home and keep it looking beautiful. Dulux teamed up with blogger and DIY extraordinaire Karen Kelly of Lovilee for a series of DIY projects around her house to share some easy tips for all South Africans to try. In the second instalment of the three-part series, the Dulux team help her refurbish her wooden garage door. She had previously started working on it and sanded the surface, but had not finished it off. To help her with tips on how to tackle this DIY project, Kelly consulted the Dulux national technical services manager, Dawid du Plessis, who took her through the steps needed to prepare the wood surface and showed her the Dulux products she would need for a long-lasting fresh look. With all this new advice and know-how, Kelly put on her DIY gear and started sanding down the surface to ensure there was no gloss residue from the previous product on the doors. After cleaning off the last bit of dust with a brush, she used mineral turpentine to clean the surface before she used the Dulux Woodgard Exterior Timba Preservative. Watch the video below Kelly had previously sanded her door and left it exposed, so the Dulux Woodgard Exterior Timba preservative was the ideal product to use, as it has added preservatives to penetrate the wood dressing for all-round protection to exterior wooden surfaces. The product was also perfect for her panelled garage door as it allows wood to breathe, and expand and contract as it needed to. Kelly says the garage door gave her house an immediate facelift.
