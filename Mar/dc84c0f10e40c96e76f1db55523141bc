The owner of Greece's most successful soccer club Olympiakos and English Championship side Nottingham Forest said on Tuesday he had contracted the coronavirus. Evangelos Marinakis, a 52-year-old Greek businessman, said he was well and receiving treatment. "The recent virus has "visited" me and I felt obliged to let the public know," he said in a social media post. "I feel good as I take all the necessary measures and I discipline to the doctors' instructions. "I strongly advise all my fellow citizens to do the same. I wish all a quick recovery." The virus has infected well over 100,000 people worldwide and killed more than 3,000. Greece has several dozen cases but no fatality so far.
