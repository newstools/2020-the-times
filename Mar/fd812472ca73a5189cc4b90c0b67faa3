Justice and correctional services minister Ronald Lamola will on Wednesday provide a detailed implementation plan on how the department will handle the 21-day national lockdown. The lockdown, from midnight on Thursday until April 16, is government's attempt to contain the spread of Covid-19, as the number of cases rise at an alarming rate.
