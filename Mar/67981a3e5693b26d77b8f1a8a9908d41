Comedian Lasizwe became the talk of the town after he stepped out at the DStv Mzansi Viewers' Choice Awards in a puffed black dress and a 'fake baby bump'. The fake bump, which many believe hinted at him “birthing” a new chapter, turned heads and got the streets talking. Rapper and reality TV star Boity Thulo left social media users drooling as she oozed sex appeal in a revealing number. TV personality Lunga Shabalala failed to impress with his zipper jacket look. DJ Zinhle was a real winner, looking hella royal in a rose gold outfit and orange train. While Somizi won the creative award for hitting the carpet in a huge hat and colourful gas mask. Pearl Modiadie also impressed in a white dress with elaborate detail, showing that class still reigns in 2020.
