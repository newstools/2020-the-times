Viewers of Boity Thulo's reality show can't decide if they love or hate Bobby, whose dramatic nature is becoming too much for most of the TV presenter-turned-rapper's fans. From the beginning, fans have had issues understanding Bobby's role in Boity's life. It has since become more confusing for them because it doesn't seem as if Bobby knows he's “staan plek”. Wednesday night's episode left tweeps shook after they watched Bobby fail to follow simple instructions.
