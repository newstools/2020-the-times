Embattled power utility Eskom said on Sunday afternoon that no load-shedding was expected on Monday. However, it warned that the possibility of load-shedding for the rest of the week “remains high”. In a statement, Eskom said that a “much improved generation system performance, coupled with low weekend demand” meant that emergency generation reserves had recovered. “However, the possibility that load-shedding may be implemented at short notice during the week remains high,” the statement read.
