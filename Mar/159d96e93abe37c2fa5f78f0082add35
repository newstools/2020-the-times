British PM Boris Johnson has tested positive for Covid-19, he confirmed on Friday afternoon. Johnson, one of the first world leaders to contract the virus, posted a video on Twitter confirming he'd tested positive for the deadly virus, which has claimed thousands of lives since it emerged late last year. "Hi folks, I want to bring you up to speed with what is happening today, that is that I've developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus; that's to say a temperature, a persistent cough and on the advice of the chief medical officer, I've taken a test that has come out positive. "So I am working from home, I'm self-isolating and that's entirely the right thing to do. But be in no doubt I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus," Johnson said in a lengthy video. He went on to thank healthcare workers, officers, teachers and volunteers for their efforts in fighting the pandemic. Johnson joins a growing list of high-profile people who've tested positive for Covid-19, including Prince Charles, Prince Albert II of Monaco, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson and Idris Elba and his wife. * This is a developing story
