Here is what you need to know Fake news Dlamini-Zuma said that spreading fake news on the pandemic was a serious criminal offence. According to the minister, the threat of a prison sentence or fine for spreading fake news about the outbreak will hopefully end the string of false claims about  the virus, which have been flooding social media and creating general confusion. The regulation applies to both the creators of fake Covid-19 news and those who spread the news through social media and other channels.

On conviction, the person will be liable to a fine or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months, or both a fine and imprisonment.

Spreading of Covid-19 intentionally, would result in the person being charged with assault, attempted murder or murder. The regulations  prohibit any person who is infected with Covid-19, or is suspected to be infected, from refusing to be examined, treated,  isolated or quarantined.
