Wash, avoid, cover, stay at home cadres, use hand sanitiser, perhaps even carry a baby on your back while in isolation. These are the messages being shared by some of the country's current and former political leaders as the nation counts down the days to the coronavirus lockdown. Limpopo's provincial government announced an awareness campaign called 'WAC — Wash, Avoid and Cover'. EFF leader Julius Malema took to social media and shared a picture of himself carrying a baby on his back as he encouraged the public to self-isolate. “Stay at home cadres,” was his message to followers. Former mayor of Johannesburg Herman Mashaba shared a picture himself on social media giving sanitisers to street vendors who handle money when interacting with customers. Former DA leader Mmusi Maimane shared on social media how his One South Africa movement was fundraising to get hand sanitisers distributed to rural areas. On Monday, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown starting from midnight on Thursday until April 16. As of Tuesday afternoon, there were 554 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in South Africa.
