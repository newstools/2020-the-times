Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi showed women a lot of love and a little sass in a short message on International Women's Day on Sunday. In a video on Instagram she showed off a fierce gown and her skills as a model, asking: "What's International Women's Day without woman and a lil sass?" Tunzi's gown was by Indonesian fashion designer Tex Saverio. The sheer white dress had crystal and feather detail, a high neck and deep slit at the front.
