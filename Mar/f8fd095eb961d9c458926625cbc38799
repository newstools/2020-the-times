SA has entered the nationwide coronavirus lockdown. The Sunday Times newsroom has committed to bringing you all the important Covid-19 news free of charge on our website during this crisis – potentially life-saving news you can trust. However, the newspaper is still being published as normal every Sunday and our reporters and editors continue to cover a range of other news: politics, investigations, lifestyle and much more. Also, Times Select is still publishing a tight, well-crafted digital overview of all the latest news and views every weekday at 5am. To help keep you engaged during this time, we have a great offer: subscribe to the Sunday Times digitally for just R60 for 60 days. That's it. There are no recurring payments and you won't be locked into anything. Here's what you get: The e-edition is an exact online replica of the Sunday Times print edition, brought to our subscribers via a service called PressReader. Once you have subscribed, you can click here to access the e-edition online. If you have already signed in on the website with your email address and password, you'll be able to click right through to the e-edition, else you will first be prompted to sign in. This offer is only available online for new subscribers. (Current subscribers can email helpdesk@timeslive.co.za for directions if they would like to add this package onto their current packages.)
