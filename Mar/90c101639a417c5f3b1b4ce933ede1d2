Eastern Cape police on Friday confirmed that AbaThembu king Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo has been arrested. He allegedly confronted members of his family at the Bumbane Great Place in the early hours of Friday. Police spokesperson Brigadier Thembinkosi Kinana said a case had been opened against the king by his son and acting regent king Azenathi Dalindyebo. “Azenathi opened a case of malicious damage to property and assault by threats at the Bityi police station,” Kinana said. Dalindyebo, who was released on parole in December, allegedly arrived at the great place at 2am. Royal spokesperson Nkosi Dumisani Mgudlwa, said it was alleged that the king broke into the main house where Azenathi was sleeping with his wife and son. Dalindyebo was released on parole after spending four years behind bars, following the remission of sentence announcement for certain categories of prisoners by President Cyril Ramaphosa last year. He had handed himself over to prison authorities at Wellington Prison in Mthatha on December 31 2015 where he started a 12-year sentence. This was after he was found guilty of arson, kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice. This is a developing story.
