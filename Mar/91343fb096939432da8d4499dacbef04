The Sunday Times is still being published and distributed to subscribers and shops every Sunday, even during SA's coronavirus lockdown. However, these highly unusual circumstances have led to some interruptions – but fear not, subscribers who missed their favourite weekend read in print can also get it online. The e-edition is an exact digital replica of the print edition of the Sunday Times, delivered via a service called PressReader. You can page through the newspaper online, via your internet browser or by using our e-edition app. The e-edition is available for subscribers only. A subscription costs as little as R80 per month (which includes daily access to Times Select). View our subscription offers here.
