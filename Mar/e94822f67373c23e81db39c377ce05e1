The 26-year-old man who fled from the hospital where he was due to undergo testing for the coronavirus has resurfaced, turning himself in and being admitted for testing, according to CNN. The man, who returned from a trip to Thailand and complained of a mild fever and sneezing, absconded from the hospital on Monday.
