The SA Maritime Safety Authority (Samsa) said on Sunday six ships were docked at or en route to the Cape Town and Durban ports before tightened Covid-19 restrictions. Regulations promulgated on March 18 provide for the prohibition of embarkation and disembarkation of certain passengers and crews at SA seaports. Another requirement is for improved hygiene control and sanitisation facilities on ships and at seaports and port facilities operated by licensed operators, offshore cargo handling facilities, port repair facilities, providers of port services, port terminals, and licensed port operations. The regulations further provide for implementation of tracking and monitoring systems at seaports, and reporting, as well as prohibition of holding of mass gatherings of more than 100 people in seaports. Update on the vessels either en route to or already berthed in a SA port: The department of transport through Samsa has established joint operations committees at port level, which will feed into a national joint operations committee situated in Pretoria.
