Police have seized various items after arresting a former consulting firm employee for allegedly making bomb threats in Gauteng. Col Katlego Mogale said the items were seized after a year-long investigation. The 47-year-old man is due to appear in the Alexandra regional court on Tuesday, where he will face charges related to the threats. “[He] was arrested on Sunday March 8 2020,” said Mogale. “He is accused of three bomb threats in 2018 and 2019 respectively, which necessitated evacuations and loss of revenue to two companies. “Another respectable financial company, which is a tenant in the same building, was also heavily affected,” she added. In a separate incident, a 50-year-old man was arrested in September 2019 for making a bomb threat at the Menlyn Maine shopping centre in Pretoria. He walked into a bank and handed a teller a note. The shopping centre was evacuated. A police sniffer dog reacted positively to the possible presence of explosive residue, but the device was later found not to be a bomb. The man was arrested and charged with contravening the Explosives Act and attempted bank robbery.
