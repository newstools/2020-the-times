Somizi had to explain himself recently when his fans questioned his allegiance to the LGBTQI+ community. This after he tweeted about forgiving rapper AKA for using the derogatory term "m***ie". AKA went on an explosive Twitter rant against Cassper Nyovest last week when he lost his cool and threw in "m***ie" in his attempt to belittle Cassper. AKA later apologised after receiving major backlash on social media. "I’d like to apologise to anybody offended by my use of the word “moffie” in a previous tweet. At some point, I thought it wasn’t a big deal to use this word. I understand now tit’s not acceptable." Somizi, one of the most influential people in the LGBTQI+ community, responded by tweeting about forgiving the rapper for his lapse in judgement. His acceptance of AKA's apology, although a great demonstration of ubuntu, received mixed reactions on Twitter. Some felt he shouldn't have accepted the apology because the rapper should have known better from the get-go. After seeing the response to his forgiveness tweet, Somizi explained why he forgave AKA. "We all make mistakes unintentionally," he said. Other people weren't as forgiving as Somizi, and said as much on Twitter.
