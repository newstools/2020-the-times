DJ Maphorisa and Bare: The Blesser's Game author Jackie Phamotse had the streets hot over the weekend when they traded shade on social media. The trouble started when Jackie responded to a video by Maphorisa, sharing her frustration over DJs who cut the music so people can sing along. “I hate it when you guys do this. Can’t we just enjoy the song?” she asked. While fans were split over whether sis was dropping truth, or just being petty, Maphorisa delivered a stinging clapback. Responding to her message, Phori said Jackie was being “stupid”. Soon the internet was a mess with reaction. Maphorisa's mentions were flooded with comments slamming him for being “unnecessary” and “petty”.
