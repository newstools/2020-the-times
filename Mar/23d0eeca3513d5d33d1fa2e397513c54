DStv Now for web browsers has a solution in the form of picture-in-picture to keep a small news window running in the corner of a computer desktop. This technology isn’t new, but there has been an important change to the DStv Now free service. Eight news channels have now been added to this service, meaning everyone can keep a news window running on their computer while they work, no DStv subscription needed.
