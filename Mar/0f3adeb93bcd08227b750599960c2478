With a beef that spans more than four years now, rappers AKA and Cassper are going to fight it out in the boxing ring this September. AKA confirmed the plans during a Twitter rant on Thursday morning, explaining that their fight was a long time coming. In a series of tweets, AKA claimed that the two were in the process of signing a boxing deal for a September fight, and put Cassper under pressure to sign the deal. The Baddest hitmaker started off by posting a video of himself at the gym hitting a boxing bag on Twitter with a caption that read, “Tag short pan. Let him know his management don’t care about him letting him do this fight.” AKA said it wasn't a joke and they were indeed going to fight it out in the boxing ring. “Y’all think I’m joking. The fight is set for September. That’s why he’s been talking about 'boxing' in his interviews. Baiting me. Trust me. September. AKA vs Pony Boy. Ten rounds ... EFC ... winner takes all.” AKA explained that the boxing plans had been there for a while and highlighted how Cassper has subtly  been hinting at it through his responses. He claimed that he was going to beat the Babygirl hitmaker in front of his friends and family. AKA also shared a DM where he told Cass to sign the contract so they could both make some coins. Cassper has not yet responded, but according to Supa Mega is set to make between R5m and R8m  from the fight.
