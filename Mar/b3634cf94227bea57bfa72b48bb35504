Roxanne Rawlins, a South African citizen in Wuhan, gives us a look at living in lockdown in the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus in the Chinese city. She is one of 184 citizens anxiously awaiting repatriation to SA. Rawlins paints a haunting picture of streets devoid of activity, lined with empty cabs and shops. She said a lack of resources has convinced her to return home, though she is sad to leave her Ukrainian fianc√©. This comes as South Africa reported its third case of the novel coronavirus on Sunday. All three are from a 10-person group, nine of whom recently returned from Italy. At the time of publishing it was still unclear when South African citizens in Wuhan would be evacuated.
