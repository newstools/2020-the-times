Plain walls begone. This is how DIY extraordinaire, Karen Kelly from the blog Lovilee, was starting to feel about the walls in her TV room. Dulux teamed up with Kelly for a series of DIY projects around her house to share some easy tips for all South Africans to try. In the third and final instalment of the three-part series the team helps her redo her TV room. Kelly and her family spend a lot of time in this room and it was starting to feel a little too clinical in white. To help her give this room a makeover she consulted the resident Dulux colour expert, Palesa Ramaisa. Kelly took the Dulux Colour expert, who has a background in interior design, through her makeover plan and they changed a few things around until they both decided on adding a feature wall to the room. Watch the video below Feature walls are a cost-effective, but instant, way to inject personality into your home. They can be anything from show-stopping, vibrant focal points to a muted, eye-pleasing pattern. Kelly wanted to bring in bohemian elements into this space and decided on doing DIY on a mud cloth-inspired stencil as a feature wall. From a light and depth point of view, the Dulux Colour expert walked her through which wall would be best suited as a feature wall. With this knowledge on hand Kelly used a few Dulux Mini Roller Testers to find the perfect grey tone for her feature wall: this nifty, cost-effective tool helps you swatch colours on your walls so you can see the shades on the physical wall and in different light. After the walls were painted with her choice of Dulux Luxurious Silk, Kelly added a few décor accessories such as incorporating plants to finish off the bohemian-inspired look she was going for.
