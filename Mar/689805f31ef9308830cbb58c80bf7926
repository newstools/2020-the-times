A light aircraft crash in KwaZulu-Natal claimed the life of one person on Sunday. According to Paul Herbst of IPSS Medical Rescue, a group of kayakers spotted the aircraft crashing in the Umkomazi River valley. When rescue services — including police search and rescue, and the Mountain Club of SA — went to the scene, there was nothing they could do. “The wreckage was located by the [search and rescue] units and unfortunately this was not a survivable accident,” said Herbst. It was only the pilot on board, he added.
