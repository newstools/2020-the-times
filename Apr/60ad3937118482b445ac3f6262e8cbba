The actress - who has been a lot more active on social media thanks to lockdown - took to Twitter to share her thoughts with her followers about lessons the coronavirus has taught the country. “I'm wondering about what we can take away from this virus.

So people can make ends meet. “There’ll be less traffic, fewer accidents, better quality of life for people and a solution to try to put more money where it belongs and perhaps this will motivate people to work ..." she said.
