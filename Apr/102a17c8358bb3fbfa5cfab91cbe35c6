A Pick n Pay store at Durban's Musgrave Centre has been shut for deep cleaning after an employee died on Thursday. Pick n Pay said in a statement that “while there is no suggestion at this stage that his sad passing was linked to Covid-19, we are, as a precaution, deep cleaning and sanitising the entire store.” The store is expected to reopen on Friday. “We have also initiated our protocol and will trace his close contacts to self-quarantine until we have more clarity,”  said Pick n Pay.
