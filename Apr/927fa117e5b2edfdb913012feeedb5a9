All individuals who tested positive immediately went into self-isolation for 14 days, and all their identified contacts went into quarantine as soon as they were traced.” The university wished affected staff and students a speedy return to good health. “UCT will provide weekly updates on confirmed cases in the university community,” added Moholola.
