Medical experts have warned that a widely-circulated WhatsApp message offering practical tips to people who have Covid-19, including eating high alkaline foods, may contain incorrect and misleading information. The message - the origins of which are not known -  offers tips on how to prepare for infection, including medication recommendations like paracetamol, Vicks and cough mixture. The message also suggests that infected patients wear gloves, which local doctors say could result in the spread of the coronavirus rather than offer protection. Those who viewed the message expressed concern about the content, stating: "This is to inform us all that the ph level for coronavirus varies from 5.5 to 8.5. All we need to do to beat the coronavirus is take in more alkaline foods that are above the ph levels of the virus." The message list fruits like lemon, lime, avocado and orange as those which provide protection. Dr Anuschka Coovadia,  a facilitator for the free helpline Doctors on Call, said the message contained a mix of "good and bad info" and she did not regard it as credible. Dr Naseeba Kathrada, a Durban-based doctor, said: "There are no specific treatments for Covid-19. We can only treat the symptoms. "The way this message has been formulated seems to suggest these are treatments for the virus."
