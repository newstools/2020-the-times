During SA's coronavirus lockdown, we are still printing and distributing the Sunday Times every weekend as usual. However, there have been inevitable interruptions in our efforts to deliver to all our subscribers and the usual shops. Here's the good news: you can still read our April 5 edition online. Click below to page through the edition or zoom in for easy reading. (On desktop, you can click the icon in the bottom right corner to expand your view to full screen.) Articles from the magazine are still published digitally on the Sunday Times website too, of course. Our subscribers can always also read the Sunday Times e-edition – an exact digital replica of the print newspaper, delivered via a service called PressReader. You can page through the newspaper via your internet browser or by using our e-edition app. Click here to access the e-edition or follow the link below for more instructions on how to do it.
