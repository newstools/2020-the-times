When you don’t stay at home, you expose yourself to contracting the virus. “Be a hero: stay at home and protect the most vulnerable community members.” The Western Cape government said it  had spent R7m on feeding schemes and food parcels during the lockdown so far. It had also started the rollout of 50,000 food parcels which  it has undertaken to fund and distribute.
