People flouting Covid-19 regulations in Durban's central business district on Wednesday felt the full wrath of police, who attempted to keep them off the streets by beating them with sjamboks and plastic pipes. Those found loitering scattered as a handful of police officers chased them through the streets of the CBD. The officers would pull up, alight from the vehicles and without saying a word, let their makeshift weapons do the talking.

It also appeared that at least one person was arrested.
