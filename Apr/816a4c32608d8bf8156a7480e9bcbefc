The global community continues to flood social media to criticise US President Donald Trump's decision to halt funding for the WHO, after he accused it of not doing enough to warn the US about coronavirus when it first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Trump addressed the media on Tuesday from the White House and revealed that a review into the role of the organisation in the US will be conducted. He instructed his administration to halt funding until the review was concluded. “I am instructing my administration to halt funding while a review is conducted to assess the WHO role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus. The WHO failed in its duty and must be held accountable.” Trump has previously been reported to have downplayed the coronavirus, spreading misinformation and of failing to heed warnings by health experts and advisers from his office. Many are accusing him of dodging accountability for his failure and are slamming him for cutting funding in the middle of a pandemic. The US is the hardest hit country by the coronavirus, with more than 600,000 confirmed cases and over 25,000 deaths, according to a BBC report. These are some of the views shared on Twitter:
