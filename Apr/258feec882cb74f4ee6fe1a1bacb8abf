It was wet and chilly in Durban on Tuesday as photographer Sandile Ndlovu snapped images around the city, from workers at the taxi rank to homeless people trying to find a meal. The South African Weather Service said severe thunderstorms were experienced in many parts of the province, as well as the rest of the country. The rain is expected to clear up on Wednesday afternoon.
