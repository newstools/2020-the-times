Impala Platinum Mine's CEO of Rustenburg operations, Mark Munroe, was released on bail of R60,000 on Friday after appearing in court for allegedly contravening lockdown regulations. Emma Townshend, from the mine’s corporate affairs department, confirmed earlier that Munroe was expected to appear in the Bafokeng magistrate’s court after allegedly calling employees back to work. This allegedly included non-essential operations. Mine spokesperson Johan Theron told TimesLIVE just before 1pm that Munroe was subsequently released on bail. Theron said the matter had been postponed to August 4. This is a developing story.
