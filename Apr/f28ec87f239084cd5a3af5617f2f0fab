Join the Fab Four as they board a submarine (a yellow one, of course) and chart a course through the Sea of Time on a quest to rescue the wonderfully trippy inhabitants of Pepperland from a band of music-hating Blue Meanies in the 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine. A special singalong version of this kooky movie, which was inspired by and includes some of The Beatles' greatest hits, will be streamed tonight at 6pm on The Beatles' YouTube channel. The lyrics to the various songs featured, which include classics like All You Need is Love and When I'm Sixty Four, will appear along the bottom of the screen, allowing you to belt them out as you enjoy a karaoke session in your living room. It's a film for kids and kids at heart, says Beatle Ringo Starr in a YouTube video promoting the online event. It was also the late John Lennon's favourite Beatles movie. “I think it's a great movie,” he said in a 1980 LA Times interview. "My son Sean loves it now, all little children love it.” • From gripping series to watch, to fun crafts to do with your children, we'll be adding a new activity to our 'Life in Lockdown' series every day.
