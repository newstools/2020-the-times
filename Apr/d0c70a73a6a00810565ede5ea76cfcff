If there’s one thing all South Africans have in common at this time, it’s that we’re spending plenty of time in the kitchen. Whether you’re making a meal to share with your family, or attempting to slap together a microwave mug cake because you’ve run out of yummy snacks, we’re all learning what our culinary strengths and weaknesses are. If you’ve been wanting to bake more but lack the know-how, an easy place to start is with Yuppiechef’s free online course, The Art of Baking. Presented by author, food blogger and TV presenter Sarah Graham, the course consists of six lessons. Lesson one covers baking basics, including 10 golden rules of baking, cake chemistry, pantry essentials and a step-by-step espresso cake recipe. Lesson two covers cookies and biscuits, lesson three homemade bread, lesson four cake basics, lesson five assembly and icing, and lesson six teaches you how to make the perfect pastry. The course includes video tutorials, lesson quizzes, theory notes and an online Q&A forum. You can complete it in your own time and revisit the course material any time you need a refresher. And if you need proof of your prowess, Yuppiechef will even issue you with a certificate of completion after you’ve completed the course. So far, 23 people have reviewed the course and all of them recommend it. One reviewer wrote, “I absolutely LOVED this course! I learnt so much and really enjoyed Sarah's style of presenting and teaching. The different ratios has opened up a whole new world for me and has made me think so much more about my whole approach to baking. The recipes are delicious and the notes very handy.” To get started, visit the Yuppiechef Cooking School page to register. • From gripping series to watch, to fun crafts to do with your children, we'll be adding a new activity to our 'Life in Lockdown' series every day.
