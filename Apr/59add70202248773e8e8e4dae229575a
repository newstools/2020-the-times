The EFF has called on police minister Bheki Cele to do to communications minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams what the government has done to ordinary citizens who have been bust violating lockdown laws. The EFF has criticised President Cyril Ramaphosa's decision to suspend Ndabeni-Abrahams after an image of her visiting former deputy minister Mduduzi Manana during the lockdown period made its rounds on social media. Ramaphosa suspended Ndabeni-Abrahams for two months, one month without pay. The red berets said the suspension was not enough to deter members of the executive from flouting lockdown rules, demanding that Ndabeni-Abrahams be removed from her duties. "We call on the minister of police and SAPS to take the same action they have done with ordinary citizens who violated the regulations. "The two-month censure imposed on the minister for breaching the lockdown is nonsensical, and suggests that ministers and members of the executive must be treated as if they are above the law," the party said. Ndabeni-Abrahams has  apologised for her actions. The EFF further called for an investigation into Manana's explanation on why Ndabeni-Abrahams was at his Fourways, Johannesburg, home. The former deputy minister said the visit was not a social one, adding that Ndabeni-Abrahams had come to collect personal protective equipment for those volunteering in the fight against Covid-19.
