About 54 patients are unallocated. “Out of a total of 7,599 contacts traced, 3,492 people have completed the 14 days monitoring period with no symptoms reported and therefore they are de-isolated. “There are 58 people hospitalised in both public and private facilities,” said Kwara Kenana, health MEC spokesperson. The unallocated cases in the district breakdown refer to confirmed cases in Gauteng that are yet to be allocated to one of the five districts in the province. “Allocating Gauteng cases to respective districts is ongoing. After obtaining further information on contact numbers and addresses from law enforcement agencies, provincial outbreak teams and the National Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD), we are able to make corrections where a case might have been incorrectly allocated to a particular district,” Kekana said.
