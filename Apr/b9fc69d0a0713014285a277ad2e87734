An Australian allegedly caught driving a Lamborghini at nearly twice the speed limit in Sydney claimed he was rushing to hospital to be tested for coronavirus, police said on Wednesday. The man was undergoing mandatory self-isolation after being pulled over for allegedly driving 160km/h in a 90km/h zone on Monday. He was fined for speeding and had his licence suspended. Police urged Australians who suspect they may have Covid-19 to call their nearest medical service first. “Drivers shouldn't break the road rules under any circumstances,” Assistant Commissioner Michael Corboy said. “If you think you may have symptoms of Covid-19 and want to seek help from a doctor or hospital, call ahead of time to book an appointment. Police said the 35-year-old man had been tested for coronavirus and was now undergoing mandatory self-isolation. It was unclear whether or not he had tested positive.
