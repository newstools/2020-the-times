In these uncertain times, we’re all dealing with new routines and sacrificing things we took for granted. But for many of us committed cinephiles, the hardest part of the lockdown has been the time apart from our beloved big screen! A recent study from Deadline.com suggests that once the cinemas reopen, many moviegoers will flock to their favourite theatre to indulge in the unmatched experience of freshly popped popcorn, spacious seats and the grand spectacle that only the silver screen can provide. However, some prefer a more practical approach, saying they’ll wait a few weeks for the coronavirus coast to clear. We want to know where you stand. Will you be making a beeline for that big screen as soon as cinemas reopen, or will you settle for the safety of small screen streaming a little longer?

Survey closing date: April 30 2020 Terms and conditions: the winner will be randomly selected and will be contacted directly via e-mail.
