Schools are set to partially reopen next week with teachers starting work  on Monday May 4 and pupils two days later. Basic education director-general Mathanzima Mweli told MPs on Wednesday that the department was planning to phase in the return of pupils to school with grades 7 and 12 pupils being the first to go back next Wednesday May 6. Other grades will return  over weeks between May and July, as the  lockdown restrictions are gradually eased, with the last batch (grade Rs) expected to go back on July 15. Mweli said that as part of managing the risk, grades 12 and  7 (which are "exit" grades would return first.

Mweli, who was addressing parliament's basic education oversight committee, said there would  be no May/June exams this year, with the time being  used for teaching. According to the department's plan, grade 12 pupils will write their preparatory exams in September with the final exams rescheduled to November/December. The matric results will most likely be released around the middle to end of January 2021, he said.
