SA is sometimes left in the dust when global fashion takes great strides forward, but not this time: the country's first virtual model, Kim Zulu, is set to take the world by storm thanks to graphic design whiz Jason Campbell, who created her in the hope of rethinking the way people buy into fashion. Virtual models such as Shudu and Noonoouri have paved the way, working with luxury designers like Balmain and Thebe Magugu. Now Zulu is set to become SA's virtual It girl. Zulu has been featured on Kangol's American Instagram account (with reposts on its accounts in Spain and Hong Kong) in line with an upcoming deal with the brand's headwear line. "I know it sounds kind of crazy but Kim is this young girl who has big dreams and she wants to show other girls that it is very possible," says Campbell . He says Kangol "sent us a message and said that they love her look. We've started the conversations and we are doing a couple more shoots with her in Kangol." Each garment and accessory is recreated to fit Zulu. To create the realistic landscapes, Campbell photographs each scene and places Zulu in them. Zulu is also set to launch her first album and TV show to stretch the limitations of what a virtual model can do with technology. "As South Africa, we always say we are 10 years behind, but this lockdown has forced us to actually realise that there is a whole environment online and we want Kim to be at the centre of that environment or even kick-start that idea of transacting online," says Campbell.
