As if the banana bread pandemic was not enough to deal with during the lockdown, social media users have now moved to individual ingredients - drinking raw eggs. The egg challenge is  the latest craze and it requires participants to either break an egg with their biceps or drink an egg with a scoop of sugar and then chase it down with alcohol. After completion, the challenger can nominate the next unfortunate candidate. But the new craze has left some, including comedian Schalk Bezuidenhout, puzzled.
