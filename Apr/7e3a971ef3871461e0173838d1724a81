The Uyajola special that aired on Sunday left Mzansi wishing they could go back to a time when their biggest worry was being caught cheating on camera by Jub Jub and his crew. Viewers realised in retrospect that they have slightly overreacted to the show. Yes, the show left many relationships completely shattered and at some point people even thought it might get cheaters killed.

Which explains why most tweeps opted to watch the special instead of the movie Contagion ,which aired at the same time on a different channel. Here are some reactions below:
