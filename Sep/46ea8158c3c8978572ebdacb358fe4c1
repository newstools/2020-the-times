Eskom pulled the plug on its plans for evening load-shedding for a second day on Wednesday. “There will be no load-shedding this evening as the generation supply situation has significantly improved,” the power utility said in a tweet. Eskom said earlier that technicians had returned some generation units to the grid, resulting in a suspension of enforced power cuts during most of Tuesday's work hours. Before the latest update on Wednesday afternoon, it had planned to impose stage 1 load-shedding from 4pm to 10pm. That will no longer be the case. TimesLIVE
