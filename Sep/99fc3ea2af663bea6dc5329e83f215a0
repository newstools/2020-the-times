If you are a vegetarian and the thought of another butternut roasted over the coals leaves you stone cold, why not try making your own paneer, an  easy-to-make fresh cheese that originated in India, to make a delicious meat-free curry. In her recently released cookbook, Home Food, (LAPA Publishers),  Trish van der Nest shares an easy recipe to make paneer at home and a deliciously unusual beetroot curry with paneer. Says Trish, “Paneer is a form of cottage cheese eaten in curries. It can be soft or firm. I learnt how to make paneer when I attended North Indian cooking classes with Alexis  Kriel who lived in India. Alexis presents vegetarian Indian cooking classes at her home in Athol in Johannesburg. She taught us a foolproof method and there is nothing nicer than making your own paneer to add to curries.” Ingredients: 2 litres milk 60ml (1/4 cup) fresh lemon juice Method: “I love any excuse to use paneer and this curry is a combination of two of my very favourite ingredients. It’s also a real winner for vegetarians. Don’t be put off by the long list of ingredients! My son Matt loves to make this curry for his digs mates at UCT,” says Trish. Ingredients: 250g firm paneer, cubed (available at good spice shops if you prefer) Juice of 2 limes and the zest of 1 lime 1 tbsp garam masala 3 tbsp coconut oil Ingredients: 4 tbsp coconut oil 5 whole cloves 2 cinnamon sticks 1 tsp mustard seeds 2 red onions, sliced 1-2 fresh chillies, deseeded and sliced 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tbsp garam masala 2 tbsp cumin seeds, dry-toasted and crushed slightly 1 tbsp ground coriander 800g raw beetroot, peeled and cubed 1 tin (400g) coconut milk, plus extra if necessary A handful of fresh coriander leaves, optional Method:
