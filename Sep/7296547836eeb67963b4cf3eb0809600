Details are beginning to emerge about the fatal shooting of Johannesburg anaesthetist Dr Abdulhay Munshi on Wednesday. An Orange Grove resident, who was watching TV at the time of the shooting, told TimesLIVE he heard multiple gunshots. “It was quick succession... bang bang and then bang bang and bang bang. “I hunt and know gunshots going off. It was with purpose. It was aggressive. You can hear when someone is shooting with purpose or panic and there was nothing panicky about that shooter.” Social media accounts state that the perpetrators had rear-ended Munshi's vehicle and when he got out to inspect the damage, they shot him. Police have not yet released a detailed statement. Brig Mathapelo Peters said only that a shooting was carried out by unknown suspects. “Police are at this stage not at liberty to disclose or confirm the deceased's identity. The motive for the shooting is yet to be determined.” The Medical Protection Society earlier on Thursday expressed the fraternity's shock at Munshi's death. “The thoughts and prayers of MPS and SA’s health-care profession are with Dr Munshi’s family during this sad time,” the society said. Munshi was one of two prominent doctors who found  themselves in the midst of a medical storm after they were blamed for the death of a 10-year-old patient after surgery. Munshi and Prof Peter Beale were charged with culpable homicide. The patient, Zayaan Sayed, died at Netcare's Park Lane Clinic in October last year, hours after Beale performed what was meant to be a routine laparoscopic operation to stop reflux. TimesLIVE
