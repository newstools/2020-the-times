Police in Limpopo made another breakthrough in the murders of businesswoman Lizette Deacon and her mother Hettie when a team of investigators arrested two more suspects on Friday morning. Limpopo police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo said a 51-year-old domestic worker, who was employed by the deceased, and another suspect aged 41 were arrested in two separate incidents. Mojapelo said the domestic worker was arrested in Polokwane about 8am and the other suspect was arrested in Ivory Park, Tembisa, in Gauteng about 9am. Police are  trying to contact a Zimbabwean, only identified as Owen, as they believe he might be able to assist them in the ongoing investigation. Mojapelo said Owen uses the surname Setsiba, Makutara or Mbedzi. Lizette owned the Ocean Basket restaurant at the Mall of the North in Limpopo. On Sunday morning, two suspects aged 30 and 35 were arrested in connection with the brutal murder of the two women, who were killed at their home in Welgelegen, next to Cycad, in Polokwane last Thursday. According to Mojapelo, the 30-year-old worked for the family at their home, and the 35-year-old worked for the family part-time. The 35-year-old suspect was arrested in Mookgophong and the second suspect in Polokwane. The  women were allegedly attacked and stabbed Â before being tied up and put in the back of their  SUV vehicle. The vehicle was found abandoned next to the R37 between Polokwane and Lebowakgomo on the same night. Limpopo provincial police commissioner Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba has commended the investigators for spending sleepless nights pursuing the suspects. The two suspects will appear in the Polokwane magistrate's court on Monday, on charges of murder, house robbery and kidnapping. Anyone with information about the whereabouts of Owen is requested to contact Lt-Col Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501 or Sgt Phaladi Makola on 082 749 2233, or the Crime stop number 0860010111.
