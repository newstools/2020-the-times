The State Security Agency (SSA) says reports of an alleged plot to assassinate the US ambassador to SA  are receiving the necessary attention. The agency said on Monday it was interacting with all relevant partners in SA and abroad, to ensure that no harm would come to ambassador Lana Marks, including any other diplomatic officials inside the country's borders. In a statement, the agency said it had noted rising public interest in the matter and would like to assure all SA citizens and interested parties that it was receiving attention. It quoted state security minister Ayanda Dlodlo as saying the SSA had a duty to protect all diplomatic official on state duty in the country. “It should be noted that the nature of the allegation and attendant threat doesn't permit us to give any detailed updates on the investigations,” it said. The statement said reports would be provided to the relevant authorities, including President Cyril Ramaphosa, minister of international relations and cooperation Naledi Pandor and relevant officials in the US administration. This follows reports by the US media that the Iranian government was considering assassinating Marks in response to the killing earlier this year of Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian major-general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The reports referenced “highly classified intel reports” as the source of the information. TimesLIVE
