The department of education has sent a team of counsellors to support the Ethembeni Secondary School community in Burgersdorp in the Eastern Cape where 102 schoolchildren tested positive for Covid-19.

The rand weakened again early on Tuesday after a sharp plunge in the previous session when fears of a second wave of global coronavirus infections triggered a worldwide sell-off of riskier assets.
