Where's the fun in being a foodie if you can't show off your creations to all your friends, not just the ones invited to dinner? That's why you need a great camera to take those high-res food shots that will rival anything seen on BBC Food – especially in the month when SA celebrates Braai Day. On the first three Sundays of September, buy a copy of the Sunday Times or visit our website to find a set of recipes for dishes with a South African heritage and inspired by Weber Sauces and Seasonings, paired with delicious cocktails from Fitch & Leedes. Compiled by celebrity chef Sandy Wood, these recipes will include a photo or two of the completed dish for inspiration – but then it's your turn. Prepare one or more of these dishes at home, take a gorgeous photo and email it to us. You will then stand a chance of winning a Canon EOS RP camera with RF 25–105mm lens (worth R33,695) or, for each of the two runners-up, a Canon TS5340 printer valued at R999. Every Sunday from September 6 to 20, we will publish three recipes for the meals and the cocktails. (Just what you need to prepare for Braai Day on September 24 too!) Choose one or more of the dishes to make, and then send us your gorgeous photographs of your dish to competitions@sundaytimes.co.za – include your full name, phone number and address, and the subject line "#STFoodiePhoto". Entries will close at 11.59pm on Tuesday September 22. Sandy Wood, the founder and chef of Sandy’s Kitchen, counts among her culinary achievements a Cordon Bleu qualification and stints with Prue Leith (London), the Ritz Escoffier (Paris), Ballymaloe (Ireland) and Giuliano Bugialli (Italy). She has worked around the world on yachts, at country lodges, and for large corporations. Her one-stop-shop now offers clients a range of options including venue sourcing, event design (decor and floral), catering and more.
