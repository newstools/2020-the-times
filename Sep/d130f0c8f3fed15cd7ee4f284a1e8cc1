The Hawks have arrested five of the seven alleged masterminds behind a R200m asbestos audit project in the Free State. Hawks spokesperson Brig Hangwani Mulaudzi confirmed that five people were arrested and said two remained on the run, while they were hot on the heels of another arrest. “We have arrested four of them. I am awaiting an update from my guys in Gauteng regarding one of the suspects there. Two of the other suspects, one in KwaZulu-Natal and Pretoria remain on the run,” he said earlier in the day. In an update after 2pm he added that five had been arrested. “We are in communication with the remaining two and have told them to hand themselves over because there is no point in them running.” TimesLIVE has it on good authority that the man sought  in KZN is a recently appointed senior official from the Richards Bay Industrial Development Zone (RBIDZ). He previously held senior positions  at the departments of trade and industry  and  energy. The arrests follow a R255m tender the Free State department of human settlements awarded in 2014 to audit and assess households in the province with asbestos roofing. The tender was awarded to Blackhead Consulting and Diamond Hill Trading. The joint venture later subcontracted Mastertrade 232 to do the audit. Mastertrade, in turn, subcontracted ORI Group to do the audit and assessment for R21.3m. Diamond Hill Trading was owned by businessman Ignatius “Igo” Mpambani who was murdered in broad daylight while driving down Sandton’s Bowling Avenue in a Bentley. Mulaudzi said the suspects would appear in the Bloemfontein magistrate's court on Friday.
