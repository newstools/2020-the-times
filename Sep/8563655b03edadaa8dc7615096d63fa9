Yet another snag for Covid-19 Ters relief payments Payments of new and outstanding applications for the Covid-19 Temporary Employer/ Employee Relief (Ters) Scheme benefits have temporarily been halted yet again for the labour department and Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) to improve controls. A damning report last week by auditor-general (AG) Kimi Makwetu identified poor financial management and verification controls, leading to millions of rand in payments to the deceased and to people in prison. SA could expect a “family meeting” as early as next week about reducing the level of lockdown restrictions. South Africa's Covid-19 recovery rate is hovering at 88.9%. Health minister Zweli Mkhize said on Thursday night, “Our recoveries now stand at 573, 003.” The latest pandemic update confirmed the death of 97 more patients in the past 24-hour cycle. They included 17 from KwaZulu-Natal, 21 from Gauteng, seven from Eastern Cape, four from Free State, one from Limpopo, 26 from Mpumalanga, 15 from North West and six from the Western Cape. We’re on a downward trajectory as the number of active Covid-19 infections and deaths drops across SA. ​This is by no means “the end” of it, say experts, but it’s a good time to reflect on what we’ve learnt.
