Rapper AKA's claim that in his decade-long career he's never copied anyone's song or style has been received with mixed emotions from fans.

With most people saying Fully In sounds like Turn Up Gang by Cassper Nyovest. However, the megacy came through for the rapper, hailing him as the king of “sampling”, not one to copy/bite ...
