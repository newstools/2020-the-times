DA shadow communications minister Phumzile van Damme has opposed the “Clicks shutdown” led by the EFF to protest against the retailer's “racist” advert featured on its website on Friday. The beauty and health  retailer continues to come under fire for the advert which labelled black  natural hair as “dry” and “damaged” and straight blonde hair as “fine” and “normal”. The advert was removed from the retailer's website. On Sunday the EFF said it would deploy its members to occupy all Clicks stores across the country and shut them down. Among party leaders deployed is president Julius Malema, who is at Mall of the North in Polokwane in Limpopo, deputy president Floyd Shivambu, who was deployed to Sandton City in Gauteng, and secretary-general Marshall Dlamini, who was sent to Mall of Africa in Midrand. Malema and a group of protesters wearing EFF regalia protested and sang outside the closed Clicks store in Mall of the North. Responding to calls from the EFF to close all Clicks stores, Van Damme questioned if this would be done at the expense of employees who are at risk of losing their jobs.  She said staff had nothing to do with the  “stupid” advert. Van Damme was also critical of the lawlessness perpetuated by Malema. “Imagine getting a criminal record because see eye see [CIC] said you must go and break the law today. I hope there will be some sense today,” she wrote in part.
