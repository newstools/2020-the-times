The health department is not considering using alcohol and other sin taxes to help fund the country’s health-care sector. This is according to health minister Zweli Mkhize, who was responding to a parliamentary question posed by the leader of Al Jama-aha, Mogamad Ganief Ebrahim Hendrick, this week. Over the past few months, the  effects of alcohol on the health-care system was thrust into the spotlight as the country battled to halt the spread of Covid-19.

But a second ban was imposed in July with President Cyril Ramaphosa insisting it was to help reduce trauma-related injuries in hospitals. Under lockdown level 1, however, the sale of alcohol for home consumption is now  allowed from Monday to Friday,  9am-5pm. Under level 2, it was allowed to be sold from Monday to Thursday. The regulations restricting alcohol sales sparked heated debates about the role the alcoholic beverage industry plays both in  society and the economy. Mkhize said his department had previously looked at using alcohol and other sin taxes to help fund the health-care sector but the National Treasury  was reluctant to accept the proposal.

'The earmarking is usually legislated and would usually lead to all or a portion of the funds being used to finance health-care services in general or a specific aspect of health care,  for example messaging on the harmful effects of alcohol. This legislative mandate lies with the minister of finance,” said Mkhize. Mkhize said historically the department of health has raised the earmarking of sin taxes, including alcohol, tobacco, sugar, as an option with the  Treasury. However, the  Treasury has been hesitant to accept earmarking,   citing the following reasons:
