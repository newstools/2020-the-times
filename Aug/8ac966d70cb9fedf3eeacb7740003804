Two police officers and at least one suspect were injured during a shoot-out in the vicinity of the Tshwane District Hospital in Pretoria on Wednesday. Gauteng provincial health department spokesperson Kwara Kekana said the incident happened in the vicinity of forensic pathology services opposite the hospital. At least one person was shot dead in a vehicle at the scene. Best Care Emergency services spokesperson Xander Loubser told TimesLIVE that two police officers were airlifted to Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg. Witnesses  said the suspects were travelling in about eight vehicles when they were confronted by police. At least seven suspects were arrested, one shot dead and another injured, it was reported. A mortuary driver at the scene told TimesLIVE that he believed the suspects wanted to take a body he had just collected. “As soon as I was about to drive out with the body, the car was surrounded by an army of people. It was about eight cars [two combis and vehicles). It's like they knew that we were collecting the body,” he said. The body was supposed to be delivered to KwaZulu-Natal, he added. “I'm glad police were here, because as soon as I was still trying to see what was happening traffic police were already here and a shoot-out ensued,” he said. His passenger said, "It's like police knew what was due to happen because they escorted us and took us to the front of the queue. They were in a hurry to get us out of there." But as they drove out, vehicles appeared. "As we were trying to figure out what was happening the suspects stormed out, a police car stopped in front of us and a shoot-out ensued.” Police were approached earlier in the day for comment but have yet to provide an update.
