Bumping into your ex after a break up can be one of the most awkward moments of your life. Now imagine you are rapper L-Tido and your ex is in the crowd screaming at you  to answer her calls. L-Tido recently took to Twitter to recount the super cringe time a former girlfriend pitched up to one of his concerts after he ignored her for weeks. “She showed up to my performance at the club. In between a song I hear someone scream 'Thato! Why you not answering my f***ing calls'," he said. The dude had already been ghosting the poor woman and decided to carry on, ignoring the entire crowd until the show ended. Fans lol’d with the artist, with some wanting to know what happened after that. Others shared their own awkward stories with exes. The City of Gold star has been vocal about relationships in the past, “warning” women against blessers and saying men are only interested in one thing. “Ladies, if a guy wants to fly you out and you ain’t trying to smash, don’t take that flight. A n**** ain’t flying you out to play 30 Seconds,” he told fans in 2018.
