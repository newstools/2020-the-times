Josef Zinnbauer has side-stepped questions over reports that Bafana Bafana captain Thulani Hlatshwayo and his Bidvest Wits teammate Deon Hotto will wear the black and white of Orlando Pirates next season. Speaking to the media through a video conference on the eve of the Absa Premiership resumption‚ Zinnbauer was asked to confirm the seemingly pending arrival of the Wits pair. The German declined to comment‚ saying his focus is only on the blockbuster clash against the defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns at Dobsonville Stadium in Soweto (6pm). “For me to comment on other players I think this is a question you can speak with maybe someone in the office‚” said the German coach. “I am the coach here and I am focused on Sundowns and not on other players. For me what it is important (at the moment) is Sundowns and I hope you understand my answer.” The 30-year-old Bafana captain Hlatshwayo is seen as the missing puzzle to solve Pirates' defensive woes over the past seasons. While Pirates have shipped in 26 goals in 23 league matches this season‚ nine more than leaders Kaizer Chiefs and 11 conceded by Sundowns‚ Wits have let just 17 in 21 matches with Hlatshwayo featuring in 18 of those matches. Only leaders Chiefs have scored more league goals than Pirates but it is in defence where Zinnbauer’s team has been found wanting and the Bafana captain Hlatshwayo is seen as the missing puzzle in the Buccaneers’ rearguard.
