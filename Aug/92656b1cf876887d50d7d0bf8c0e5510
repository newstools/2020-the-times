While KwaZulu-Natal prepares for a peak  in Covid-19 infections, being tipped as the next epicentre in the country, health minister Zweli Mkhize has justified the  number of unused beds in the province. Mkhize, who is in the province for the next two days, conducted a doorstop visit to Richmond Hospital in the  KwaZulu-Natal Midlands on Thursday. What was previously solely a TB facility, the hospital  was entirely restructured and now has 95 beds, including quarantine and isolation wards. The health department in  KwaZulu-Natal benefited from a massive cash-injection to construct a number of field hospitals as well as refurbish dilapidated facilities to cope with a surge in infections. However beds remain empty. MEC for health Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu told reporters that people were not coming to hospitals. “People are not coming to hospitals. Don't wait until you are too sick, come to our facility. We have more than enough beds for you to use.” Mkhize justified the unused beds as  an investment for the province. “We can't allow our people to be seen in a place that is not suitable. It is very important for us to ensure our people are treated with dignity.” Mkhize, who knows the Richmond area well, said there was a  need for a TB hospital in Richmond  in the past, but since the outbreak of Covid-19 there was a greater need to restructure the dilapidated facility. He said the hospital was  greatly needed by  the community and a well-needed investment  for both the region and district. The minister will conduct an oversight visit  to Clairwood Hospital, south of Durban, and on Friday will visit Madadeni Hospital in Newcastle as well as a hospital in Utrecht, northern  KwaZulu-Natal.
