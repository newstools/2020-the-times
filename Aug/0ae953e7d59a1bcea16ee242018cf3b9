Nando's embarked on a project to grow its own peri-peri chilli - a project aimed at empowering small farmers in Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe and SA through regional farming organisations. To date the PERi-Farmers initiative has involved more than 1,400 farmers in producing the unique African chilli. Nando's aim is to use the original peri-peri chilli in all its production of sauces, bastings and marinades, and in doing so, help improve the lives of the farmers. The gorgeous, red, shiny jewels of heat may be small but when it comes to flavour they pack a mouth-tingling punch that, according to the Scoville rating, is very hot - just how South Africans like it.
