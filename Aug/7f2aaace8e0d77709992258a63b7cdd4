Zozo was assaulted and stabbed in full view of a number of people, including her younger sister who is in Grade 5, in Dutywa on August 17. After her funeral at the weekend, Zozo’s parents, Ntombekhaya Lugalo-Zozo and Mzulungile Zozo, said they have accepted she is gone forever. “The only thing I want now is justice for Kwasa,” Lugalo-Zoza said. “Kwasa did not deserve to die such a horrible death. Her untimely passing has left us with scars that may never heal. But her life gave us memories no-one can take away. The courts must play their part in the war against gender-based violence.” Zozo’s father said: ''Nelson Mandela got a life sentence and spent 27 years in jail for fighting for freedom. The day the killer gets 100 years in jail, I will say for Kwasa, justice has prevailed.'' The student was doing a BSc in biochemistry, and would have turned 20 on October 3. She matriculated at Mida Christian School in Dutywa in 2019. This is the same school Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi attended. Daily Dispatch
