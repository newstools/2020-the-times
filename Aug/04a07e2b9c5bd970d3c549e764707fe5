The Gamedock Cup #1 was a huge success, and a great way for South African esports fans (and players) to spend their time over the past weekend. We saw some of South Africa's top Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) teams compete for their share of the R20,000 prize pool - and those who dropped out early could compete for some shiny skins. On Sunday August 9 the Gamedock Cup #1 came to a conclusion, with some great local casting. It was a joy to watch all the matches available, and it ended with ATK Arena's CS:GO team taking home the trophy in spectacular fashion. In fact, ATK Arena didn't drop a single map during the entire tournament. ATK Arena began their upper-bracket run by defeating Royalty Esports 2-0, then moving on to knock Sinister5 down to the lower bracket with another 2-0. In the semifinals, ATK Arena beat Goliath Gaming 2-0, claiming their spot in the grand finals. Goliath Gaming refused to go down without a fight. The team made their way to the grand finals by taking out Energy Esports in a close 2-1 match. For their trip through the upper-bracket, ATK Arena had a one-map advantage over Goliath Gaming and didn't allow Goliath Gaming even a small taste of victory which comes with a map win. In the end, the grand final score was 3-0 in the favour of ATK Arena, who showcased a dominating performance throughout the tournament. For their first-place finish, ATK Arena claims R6,500, while Goliath Gaming gets R5,000, and Energy Esports gets R3,500 for their third-place finish. The first-ever Gamedock cup was exciting to watch, and we hope to see more local CS:GO esports action from Gamedock in the future. If you couldn't watch the action live, you can always catch up by visiting the Gamedock Twitch.tv channel. This article was brought to you by Esports Central.
