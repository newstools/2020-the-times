The National Coronavirus Command Council will on Monday brief the media on the regulations for Covid-19 lockdown level 2. President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday announced that SA would  be moving to level 2 of the lockdown from midnight on Monday, with bans on travel between provinces and the sale of alcohol and tobacco products being lifted. It has been five months since a national state of disaster to combat  the coronavirus pandemic was declared. Over the  past three weeks, the number of new confirmed cases has dropped from a peak of more than  12,000 a day to an average in the past week of about  5,000 a day. While the virus appears to have peaked in several provinces, including the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Gauteng and possibly in KwaZulu-Natal,  Ramaphosa has warned against complacency as the country moves to  level 2.
