Former EFF Gauteng chairperson Mandisa  Mashego was among political leaders who made an appearance  at the launch of Herman Mashaba's  new  ACTIONSA party. This comes amid strong rumours that Mashego would be joining Mashaba's  new party. Mashaba this week  admitted that he has  a close relationship with Mashego dating back to his days as  Johannesburg mayor when he led  a coalition government supported by the EFF. He  said he would love for Mashego to join his party but that there was no agreement  yet. Mashego resigned from her job as EFF chairperson and the party caucus leader in the Gauteng legislature in April this year after she lost to Marshall Dlamini for the position of party secretary-general. She had been seen as one of the rising stars in the EFF but her candidacy against Dlamini, a strong Malema ally, dashed her chances. Since then, speculation has been rife that she was in talks with Mashaba to join the new party. Mashego  congratulated the new political party  on its  formation. “It's very important that diversified political voices enter the political space and even contest elections in order to have a different and fresh innovative but, more importantly, a political party or political parties and individuals who are ready to grab the bull by the horns and bring much needed economic justice,” said Mashego. She said she was excited for the communities of Ekurhuleni, Tshwane and Johannesburg  as they would now have one more option on the ballot. Mashego wished Mashaba  luck, saying that SA needed the party. TimesLIVE
