Of the latest deaths, 42 were in the Eastern Cape, 20 in the Free State, 26 in the North West, 76 in Gauteng, 54 in KwaZulu-Natal, 22 in Mpumalanga, 18 in the Northern Cape and 28 in the Western Cape. “The recoveries now stand at 461,734 which translates to a recovery rate of 79%," said Mkhize. The statistics were based on 3,351,111 total tests, of which 35,614 were done in the most recent 24-hour cycle. The figures show that Gauteng now has 197,531 total infections.
