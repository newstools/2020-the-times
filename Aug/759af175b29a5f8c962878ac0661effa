Four  teenagers were hailed as heroes  after they saved an 11-year old boy from drowning  in Port Alfred at the weekend. Kendra Shuman, 14, Jessica Harty and Jadelyn Shuman, both 15, and Jack Botha, 16,  rescued the boy and brought him to safety after he was swept out to sea in rip currents at Kelly’s Beach on Saturday afternoon. “NSRI rescue swimmers responded directly to the beach and Guardmed Ambulance services were activated,” said National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) spokesperson Craig Lambinon. “On arrival at the scene it was found that a  child had been swept out  to sea. Four local teenagers who were on the beach at the time noticed  this and went to the child’s assistance, swimming through the surf to reach  him. They managed to bring  him safely to shore,” said Lambinon. He said the boy was treated  on the scene by NSRI medics for non-fatal drowning symptoms and he was handed into the care of paramedics and transported to hospital in a stable condition. “NSRI commends the four local teenagers who went to the child’s aid.” In a separate incident, Lambinon said four crew members managed to swim back to safety after their 5m skiboat capsized at Kowie River mouth in Port Alfred on Saturday morning. “We responded directly to the beach and sea rescue was launched. Police and emergency medical services were placed on alert, but all four members were able to swim to the beach and they were not injured. “The boat drifted to the beach where it threatened to be washed back out to sea in the heavy  surf, but the NSRI were able to rig a rope to hold the boat on the beach and prevent it from being washed out to sea.” -DispatchLIVE
