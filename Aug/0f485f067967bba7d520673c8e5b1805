The Gauteng health department will institute disciplinary action against staff allegedly involved in the swapping of newborn babies at the Tambo Memorial Hospital in Boksburg. “The department finds this incident regrettable. The hospital concedes that the identification of the babies in procedure for discharge was not properly followed,” said provincial health spokesperson Kwara Kekana.

The mothers were interviewed and provided counselling. The matter was referred to a social worker to facilitate DNA testing at the request of one of the fathers, Kekana said. The children have been admitted at the same hospital pending DNA results.
