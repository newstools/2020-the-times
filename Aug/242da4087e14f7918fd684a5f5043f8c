From August 17 2020, Avbob has not been charging anyone who conducts a funeral with Avbob Funeral Service for any personal protective equipment (PPE)**. Until then, these costs were for the account of the family of the deceased. This benefit will be provided until December 31 2020. For more than 100 years, Avbob has put people at the forefront of its business. This ethos has set it apart from its competitors in the SA business space. As the largest mutual assurance society in SA, Avbob has remained true to its core belief as expressed during the Spanish Flu in 1918 — that each human being is entitled to a dignified funeral, at an affordable price. R320m in free funeral benefits In the last financial year (July 2019 to June 2020), Avbob Funeral Service provided free funeral benefits to the value of R320m to its members. During July 2020 the benefits totalled R50m. 102 years of sharing value Avbob’s shared value business model is rooted in its status as a mutual society. It has no external shareholders, only members (policyholders). Value is shared with its members through special bonuses and the provision of free funeral benefits which are over-and-above the policy value. These include up to R17,000 free funeral benefits* provided by Avbob Funeral Service: Sufficient capacity on all fronts to handle increase in Covid-related deaths Avbob remains confident that it has sufficient capacity to meet the possibility of an increase in demand that can arise due to a spike in mortality rates caused by Covid-19, while maintaining the highest quality standards in the provision of funeral services and funeral products.

It has also converted shipping containers into temporary mortuaries in case there are major unexpected spikes in the mortality rate. * Terms and conditions apply.
