Wayde van Niekerk’s planned comeback to international racing in Italy on Saturday night has been put on hold after he tested positive for Covid-19. The rest of the SA contingent were negative, a member of the Van Niekerk camp told TimesLIVE. That includes the Olympic 400m champion’s coach tannie Ans Botha, teammates Ruswahl Samaai and Antonio Alkana, his agent and physio, who had worked on Van Niekerk daily. Van Niekerk, who was feeling healthy and no ill effects, was awaiting the result of a second test to confirm if he is indeed positive.

ANC MP  Zamuxolo Joseph Peter, who was a member of parliament's portfolio committee on tourism, has died after a short illness due to Covid-19, the committee said on Friday night.

In March, the site offered respite to more than 300 people.
