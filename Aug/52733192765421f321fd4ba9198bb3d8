DA MP Tsepo Mhlongo has been accused of shopping for alcohol during an online parliamentary session. MPs were livid at video of him allegedly ‘walking at a liquor store while connected to a sitting of parliament’. A visit by deputy public protector Kholeka Gcaleka to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto on Wednesday afternoon exposed alleged poor working conditions at the facility. Although she was assured by management earlier in the day that they had sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) for workers, Gcaleka’s interaction with staff painted a different picture. The Special Investigating Unit is probing 658 cases of possible corruption linked to state procurement of Covid-19 personal protective equipment worth more than R5bn. Here, it expands on some of these, including suppliers, scooters, water tanks and the Beitbridge fence.
