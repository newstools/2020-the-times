In a video posted on Instagram and Twitter, the athlete be seen lying in bed as he confirmed he'd tested over the weekend and had no symptoms thus far. “Just woke up, like everyone else, checked social media [and] saw social media saying I'm confirmed to have Covid-19. Did a test on Saturday. Trying to be responsible so I'm going to stay in and stay away from my friends. And also having no symptoms so I'm going to quarantine myself and wait on confirmation to see what is the protocol.” The sports star ended  the video by urging fans to stay safe, adding that he'd get in touch with friends to urge them to do the same.
