Five months into the Covid-19 pandemic, financial distress remains a concern among South Africans, with as many as 61% reporting a loss of income. This is according to the latest research results on the socio-economic impact of the coronavirus conducted by the market research company Ask Afrika. The survey also found that many people were not as worried about  contracting the virus  than when it broke out in SA in March. “Fear of unemployment is now higher than the fear of contracting Covid-19,  even though those two fears are  top-of-mind for citizens,” said Ask Afrika CEO Andrea Rademeyer. In terms of emotional distress, 50% of South Africans were identified as concerned about underlying health conditions. “In this context, it is especially detrimental that citizens fear going to clinics and hospitals, and many are falling behind with their medication and testing for underlying conditions. Almost certainly a second health crisis is being created during lockdown,” said Rademeyer. To deal with financial distress, the survey found many people had resorted to  borrowing and selling  personal assets. “The survey found 45% of loans taken are below  R1,000. Only 12% are more than R3,000. Around 40% of citizens loaning money are not confident about repaying the loans,” Rademeyer said. The survey's key findings include: “Interestingly, despite very low trust in the police, citizens are still twice as likely to report cases to the police than to whistle-blowing hotlines or Corruption Watch. This indicates a strong prerogative to structurally change the whistle-blowing entities,” said Rademeyer. TimesLIVE
