Tutorials in key subjects to help this year's matric pupils will be broadcast on free to air television channels from next week. Basic education minister Angie Motshekga said the initiative will give pupils the support they need to prepare for the final exams after an academic year disrupted by Covid-19. “This initiative has come at the right time, when we are working to get schooling back on track. Matric is always stressful, but 2020 has been filled with unusual stresses. It is abundantly clear additional support is required for pupils and we will continue to provide this. There are a few months left before the end of the year, and Woza Matrics will give pupils the support they need to prepare for the final exams,” she said. An experimental Covid-19 vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca could be put before regulators this year if scientists are able to gather enough data, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group said on Tuesday. "It is just possible that if the cases accrue rapidly in the clinical trials, that we could have that data before regulators this year, and then there would be a process that they go through in order to make a full assessment of the data," Andrew Pollard told BBC Radio. The Oxford vaccine showed early promise in the first human trial when it produced an immune response, underlining its position as one of the leading candidates in the race to produce a vaccine against a disease that has crippled the global economy. —Reuters The Covid-19 pandemic has brought with it a slew of delays for the judicial system, including the trial of a KwaZulu-Natal mother accused of murdering her six-year-old daughter. Fungai Nyamadzawo, mother of slain Alexia, made a brief appearance in the KwaDukuza magistrate's court on Tuesday where her mental observation report from Fort Napier psychiatric hospital was expected to be submitted.

As most of SA's pupils returned to the classroom on Monday, 21-year-old Sharon Ndlovu was not feeling optimistic about what remains of the academic year. She said she was anxious, confused, pressured and felt that not enough information had been given. “There is too much pressure. We were told that we are only attending for this week and we will take a break and then return again. I am scared that I am not going to cope because we are getting too much work to do in a short time,” she said. Allaying a child’s fears of Covid-19 when her teacher has succumbed to the virus is tough, parents tell us. An expert explains how to help them through it. Poor infrastructure, shortages of staff and medication, and ailing patients forced to wait in the rain — these were among the problems health activists and human rights monitors found at clinics in Uitenhage and Despatch last week. “We are concerned that in the fight against Covid-19, we have neglected primary health care services especially in the Eastern Cape.
