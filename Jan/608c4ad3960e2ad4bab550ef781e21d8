Chad da Don has hit back at suggestions he moved on from ex Kelly Khumalo "too fast and is a player". The rapper, who was in an on-off relationship with Kelly until late last year, recently posted a snap on Instagram with his new bae and looking all loved up. While many were here for the couple, one tweet claimed Chad had the "superpower of moving on so fast" and suggested the star was a player. Chad was not here for the criticism and told the hater where to get off. "Fuck you, b*tch. What do you know about me?" While the user apologised for "disrespecting" the star, Chad took it with a pinch of salt. "If you a were a fan you would have my back. Didn’t sound like you did G. Especially labeling me as a player. Meantime you have no idea what happened in my life or past, you just assume. Don’t do that. Apology accepted though." Chad's new bae, Carla, also weighed in, telling haters to "move on, drink water and mind your own business". Chad and Kelly were reportedly engaged, and even got matching tattoos on their ring fingers before rumours of a break-up hit social media last year. The pair deleted pictures of each other from their social media accounts, with neither of them officially confirming their break-up. Chad was criticised for showing off his new romance, but told a follower earlier this month that he was not losing sleep over people's opinions about his love life. "Lions don't lose sleep over the opinions of sheep," he wrote.
