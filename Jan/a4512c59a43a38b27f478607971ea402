The N1 highway in the Huguenot Tunnel, outside Cape Town, was closed on Monday afternoon following a collision between a truck and a bakkie. According to preliminary reports, two people were injured - one of them seriously. Western Cape traffic services chief Kenny Africa described it as a "head-to-head" collision between the two vehicles. "The tunnel is closed. Motorists should please use the old Du Toit's Kloof Pass," said Africa.
