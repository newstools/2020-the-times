If your world has been  shaken  by slower internet speeds over  the past 10 days, an undersea earthquake might be to blame. Writing in Business Times today, tech guru Arthur Goldstuck  says the most likely cause of breaks in two undersea cables linking SA to the world wide web was a 5.6 magnitude earthquake near Ascension Island in the Atlantic. A ship set sail from Cape Town this week  to repair the cables  but may only complete its work  in 10 days' time. Until then, SA will be short of about  one-third of its usual  bandwidth. Many service providers used one of the broken cables as backup for the other, and said a scenario in which both failed simultaneously  was unprecedented. However, customers of the major mobile network operators -  Vodacom and MTN -  were largely unaffected, as these tend to have both part-ownership and access to most of the cables running up both the east and west coasts of Africa.Business Times
