The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) said the owner of Nyati Bush and Riverbreak Lodge was obstructing their work on Tuesday after the SAHRC's delegation was locked out of the property. A delegation from the commission and Enoch Mpianzi’s parents were informed while travelling to the lodge in North West that the owner was seeking legal opinion. They found the lodge's gates locked. Buang Jones from the commission held a brief press conference outside the locked gates. “It demonstrates an uncaring attitude on the part of Nyati Bush and we have brought this to the attention of SAPS,” he said. Jones said the commission was permitted in terms of legislation to enter any premises for the purpose of exercising its powers and performing its functions. Jones called the owner several times but the calls were  unanswered. This happened despite an initial agreement between the commission and the owner about a site visit on Tuesday afternoon. “We have discussed this briefly with the detective, who is currently speaking with his superiors for us to enter these premises. Nyati Bush remains a crime scene until the police have finalised their investigations,” said Jones. Jones told journalists outside the gate: "We have also been alerted that this is not the first time a young person died on these premises. Ten years ago there was a pupil who also perished here, and this is something that concerned us,” he said. The commission said the lodge was accredited by the Tourism Authority of South Africa and would be reported to the department of tourism.
