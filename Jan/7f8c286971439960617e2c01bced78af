If you want to see genius at work, look no further than this clip of DJ Cleo in studio with the late kwaito star Mandoza. DJ Cleo shared a throwback video of himself working with Mandoza in studio. It was taken while the pair were working on their hit Sgelekeqe. The pair look a lot younger in the “never seen before footage” shared by Cleo on Twitter. Cava the throwback!
