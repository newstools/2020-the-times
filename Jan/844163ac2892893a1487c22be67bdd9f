Dubbed its funniest yet, Chicken Licken has unveiled its new “easy bug” advert, featuring Khanyi Mbau and veteran actor Rapulane Seiphemo. Titled “Everyone’s Talking About It”, the ad shows a guy who is sleeping and hungry. He wakes up and changes TV channels. All are seemingly talking about offers from the South African  fast-food outlet. A classic Generations spoof can be seen as Rapulane re-enacts the soapie's scene in which he confronts Karabo Moroka, played by Connie Ferguson, for cheating on him. Mbau can be seen making a cameo in a Being Bonang parody. The ad also features a Clientele Life parody advert, in which a man talks about “four delicious meals” at a funeral. Watch the video below. The ad appeared on local TV screens on Tuesday and was the talk of the day on social media. Here is a snapshot of what tweeps had to say about it.
