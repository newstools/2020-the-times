LeBron James has broken his silence after  the death of his friend and mentor Kobe Bryant, in an emotional post. Bryant died on Sunday in a helicopter crash in Los Angeles. His 13-year-old daughter Gianna was also killed in the crash, along with seven other people. “Man, I sitting here trying to write something for this post but every time I try, I begin crying again just thinking about you, niece Gigi and the friendship/bond/brotherhood we had!” wrote James on Instagram. “I literally just heard your voice Sunday morning before I left Philly to head back to LA. Didn’t think for one bit in a million years that would be the last conversation we’d have. WTF!!” Bryant's final post on Twitter before his death was a message to James, telling him: “continuing to move the game forward King James. Much respect my brother.” James sent his condolences to Bryant's wife  Vanessa and his three children, Natalia Diamante, Bianka Bella and Capri Kobe. “I promise you, I’ll continue your legacy man! You mean so much to us all here especially [the] Laker Nation and it’s my responsibility to put this sh** on my back and keep it going!! “Please give me the strength from the heavens above and watch over me! I got US here! There’s so much more I want to say but just can’t right now because I can’t get through it! Until we meet again my brother!” said James.
