News that convicted racist Vicki Momberg is suing for her alleged “unlawful arrest and detention” has been met with mixed reactions online. Momberg was arrested in 2016 and released from prison in December after the special remission of sentences announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa on December 16 2019. Momberg was serving her sentence for crimen injuria after a viral video in 2016 showed her using the k-word more than 40 times against police officers and 10111 operators trying to help her after a smash-and-grab incident. She became the first South African to be jailed for using racist language. However, now that she is out of prison Momberg is chasing a huge payout and if successful she could be R8.5m richer. TimesLIVE reported that Momberg intended to sue the police and justice ministers, the national director of public prosecutions (NDPP) and provincial and national top cops. Momberg’s lawyer, Anesh Sukdeo, told TimesLIVE that his client was suing the departments and the NDPP, R2.5m of which was for “unlawful arrest and detention” and R1m for “defamation, pain and suffering and anguish”. An additional R2.5m was for “malicious legal proceedings” and another R2.5m for “wrongful and malicious legal proceedings”. On Twitter, Mzansi had a lot to say about the lawsuit. Many said Momberg was “rightfully” exercising her “white privilege rights” with zero sense of shame. Here is a snapshot of some of the reactions:
