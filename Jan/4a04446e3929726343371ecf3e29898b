Tributes for NBA legend and LA Lakers star Kobe Bryant have poured in since confirmation of his death in a helicopter crash in California on Sunday. Bryant's 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, also died in the crash. Former US president Barack Obama said Kobe was “a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act”. Bryant retired from the NBA in 2016. It's believed he was on his way to a training camp with his daughter. Officials said it would “take a few days” to recover all the bodies. Nine people were reported to be on board the aircraft. Messages of condolences for others affected by the tragedy have also been pouring in.
