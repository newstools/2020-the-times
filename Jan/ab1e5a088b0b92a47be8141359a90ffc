Last night's episode of Skeem Saam had more drama than a Nollywood movie, and while every second packed its  own action, it was Meikie having a gun and actually shooting it that left viewers gobsmacked. If you are a fan of Skeem Saam, then you will know that they've been building up the Tumishang storyline to its peak, and it looks like Meikie owning a gun is exactly what was necessary to push it there. Not only does the Maputla matriarch own a gun, that no-one can remember her buying, but she shot Tumishang. The dramatic scene left tweeps wilding. Not only because they couldn't believe that “miss goody-two-shoes” Meikie was on her way to prison, and that Tumishang had finally exposed himself for the psycho he is, but because Maputla also had no idea that Meikie owned a gun.
