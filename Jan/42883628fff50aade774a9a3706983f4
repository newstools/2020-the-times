A man eating lunch with his family suffered burns after being “indirectly struck” by lightning at a hotel in Gauteng on Friday. The 50-year-old reportedly suffered moderate injuries after the strike in Boksburg North. ER24 spokesperson Ross Campbell said in a statement that paramedics received a distress call from a community-based emergency vehicle and arrived at the scene around 4pm. “The man had apparently been eating lunch with his family under a gazebo when the lightning struck nearby,” he said. “He suffered burns to his leg as well as other moderate injuries and was treated on scene before being transported to a private hospital in the area for further care.” The SA Weather Service issued an alert earlier in the day for possible severe thunderstorms across parts of Gauteng.
