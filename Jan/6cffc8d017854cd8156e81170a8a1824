A 13-year-old girl who tried to jump out of her classroom window during an exam, confessed to a drug addiction and to suffering a rape ordeal, is sitting at home because her school will not allow her back without a guarantee that she will not harm herself or others. Her father says they're victimising her, but the school is demanding a letter from a psychologist or psychiatrist.
