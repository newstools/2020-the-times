I feel sorry for the women in your lives.” She also called out the tweep's behaviour as abuse, as he was doing nothing but throwing his masculinity around. “FYI this is abuse starts because your masculinity can’t stand that a woman did it on her own!

How late they came into my life, where and how I was raised. Do you know I didn't have money for tertiary? Do you know I worked five years with no pay? Do you know how my family struggled? FOH with your bitterness ...”
