Two elderly women aged 60 and 90 were shot  dead by a group of armed men at their home in Gogobole village in Limpopo at the weekend. Police said the incident occurred at 9.30pm  on Sunday. “About five armed suspects forced entry into a house at Gogobole village under Tshilwavhusikhu policing area by breaking the window at about 21.30 and allegedly started shooting at the family members, instantly killing a 90-year-old woman and her 60-year-old daughter,” said police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo. He said one family member escaped unhurt and nothing was taken from the house. Police said a manhunt was immediately ordered  and four men aged between  24 and 46 were apprehended. “The horrendous nature of these crimes necessitated a 72-hour activation plan which was immediately implemented. After intensive investigations which  took less than 24 hours, the police managed to arrest four suspects on 15 June 2020,” said Mojapelo. The acting provincial-police commissioner of Limpopo Maj-Gen Jan Scheepers commended the police for the swift arrest of the suspects. Scheepers also instructed that the remaining suspect be hunted down and brought to book. The deceased have been identified as Matamela Ramala, 90, and her daughter Martha Ramala, 60. “The motive behind this incident is currently not known and will be determined by the unfolding investigations.” The suspects have since been charged with two counts of murder. They were expected to appear in Tshilwavhusikhu magistrate's court on Wednesday. People with information that could lead to the arrest of the remaining suspect were  requested to contact police.
