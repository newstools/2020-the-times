SA National Parks (SANParks) has announced that self-drive excursions for day visitors will be permitted from Monday in parks that cater for self-drives. SANParks CEO Fundisile Mketeni said SANParks used this week to prepare for the expected arrivals of guests to parks. President Jair Bolsonaro threatened Friday to pull Brazil from the WHO over "ideological bias," as his counterpart Donald Trump said the US economy was recovering from the coronavirus pandemic and Europe sought to reopen its borders. Adding fuel to the political fire raging around the pandemic, its origins and the best way to respond, Bolsonaro criticised the World Health Organisation for suspending clinical trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 -- a decision it reversed this week -- and threatened to follow in Trump's footsteps by quitting. President Cyril Ramaphosa has expressed concern about the number of beds in Covid-19 facilities, asking the province's local government to get more. Ramaphosa visited the province on Friday where he assessed the Covid-19 response of the Western Cape. "We are going to pull out all stops to make sure that we have more beds than whats we have now and more beds than whats they have planned. I have said that I want see more beds being installed here so we are ahead of the curve so that we are not caught with our proverbial pants down. We must be able to defeat this virus."
