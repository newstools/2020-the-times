Celebrity chef Lesego “Les Da Chef” Semenya has weighed in on gender-based violence in SA, claiming that SA's issues run deeper than just alcohol consumption. Gender-based violence and femicide have dominated headlines this week after the deaths of Tshegofatso Pule and Naledi Phangindawo reignited calls for the government to take action. Tshegofatso was found hanging from a tree in an open veld in Roodepoort on Monday after going missing last week. She was eight months pregnant. Naledi was attacked while attending a cultural function over the weekend in KwaNonqaba, Mossel Bay. The murders also sparked a debate on whether alcohol was to blame for the violence. Lesego took to Twitter to claim that “the level of violence and hatred for women is beyond just alcohol consumption”. He said that men around the world drink, but they do not murder at the rate SA men do. “Men all over the world drink alcohol but they don't go out and kill women on the levels we do in SA. The issue isn't booze, this thing in SA runs much deeper and needs serious focus and strategy,” he said. He called for a separate investigations unit to be set up to deal with gender-based violence. “A separate section on the same level as the Hawks, independent from cops but legally backed by laws and government, solely focused on this issue. Where women will feel safe and know they will be heard. Where whistle-blowers will be listened to. We need proper structures,” he explained. He also shaded the ministry of women, youth and persons with disabilities, asking what power it had.
