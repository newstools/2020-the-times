Media personality Somizi defended himself  against claims that he is greedy and taking all the opportunities, saying he won't fumble the bag for public opinion. Somizi officially announced his latest project, a cook/talk show on social media this week, but instead of unanimous joy, his announcement split Twitter. While some were super excited at the prospect of having Somagag back on screens, others accused the Idols SA judge of being “greedy”. They claimed there were other “far more deserving” chefs that could have landed cooking shows. However, Somizi was ready for backlash, and he clapped back hot and spicy! “They just need to put in the work to even be in the same conversation as Somizi. You forget that this man has hustled and put in the work for decades. Somizi wasn't built in a day.” The unapologetic star told tweeps who complained about seeing his face to kindly log out ... from their social media or their mainstream media because he didn't intend on slowing down for their benefit. “People tend to forget that the entertainment industry in SA is very fickle, short-lived and grossly underpaid in comparison to Hollywood. Multiple streams of income are needed to survive in this cut-throat industry. Somizi is doing what he has to do. Period.” SomG added that he isn't the businessman and the star brand that he is today because he let moneymaking opportunities go to accommodate “abantu bazothini syndrome”. The conversation left Twitter split right down  the middle, and it was #TeamSomizi vs #TeamOpenUpTheIndustry.
