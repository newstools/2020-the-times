At least eight people have been killed and  32  injured after a truck  ploughed into several vehicles and pedestrians in Jozini, northern KwaZulu-Natal, on Wednesday. Many of the injured were in serious or critical conditions. Transport minister Fikile Mbalula said the driver initially said his brakes failed, but subsequent investigations found that he "may have been driving under the influence of alcohol". “We call on all road users to exercise restraint and refrain from excessive alcohol consumption. Eight people have died and their families are now in mourning all because of the possible reckless behaviour of one individual. This is deplorable and simply unacceptable,” said Mbalula. KZN emergency medical services (EMS) spokesperson Robert McKenzie said paramedics, including from private services, treated 32 patients on the scene. “The exact circumstances resulting in the crash are being investigated by the police and are not known at this stage,” he said. Initial reports from emergency workers at the site indicated that the truck lost control and crashed into as many as 10 vehicles before veering into stalls occupied by street vendors.
