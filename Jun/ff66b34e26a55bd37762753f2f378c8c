Protests sparked by video footage of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody on May 25 have erupted across the US. National Guard troops were deployed in 15 states and Washington DC in an attempt to quell a sixth night of violence on Sunday. President Donald Trump has condemned the killing of Floyd and promised justice, but has also described the protesters as “thugs”.
