A three-year-old child has been found dead in Orange Farm, south of Johannesburg, Gauteng police said on Thursday. The toddler’s lifeless body was found stuffed in a plastic bag by a person collecting plastic in the veld, said Capt Kay Makhubele. “On arrival, police established that the child was killed as she had a stab wound on her upper body,” said Makhubele. “It was further established that it is the child who was reported missing yesterday [Wednesday]  in Orange Farm.” Anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee shared a video on Twitter showing community members praying at the site where the child’s body was found. The video shows tall grass and rubbish strewn at the site. A woman is heard wailing while others pray. A case of murder is under investigation, said Makhubele. No arrests have been made yet.
