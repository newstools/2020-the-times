Spokesperson Brig-Gen Hilton Smith said the offices  were evacuated on Tuesday and would be closed  for two days for deep cleaning and decontamination. The two members have since been placed under quarantine. “As a precautionary measure, all employees who, at any given time in the last 14  days, came into contact with the positive persons [are] to immediately consult with medical specialists for Covid-19 screening and testing,” Smith said.
