The royal family imbizo has resolved to remove Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo as king of AbaThembu and replace him with his son Azenathi. Royal family spokesperson Chief Dumisani Mgudlwa confirmed the resolution. A briefing at the Bumbane Great Place, 40km from Mthatha, heard the imbizo had expressed unhappiness with the king's behaviour and believe that his jail time didnâ€™t rehabilitate him. In 2015 Dalindyebo was convicted of arson, kidnapping, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice. His son became acting king, a position he held even after his father's release from prison in December. Dalindyebo is living at the Nkululekweni residence in Mthatha after serving four years of his 12-year sentence when President Cyril Ramaphosa granted him special remission parole as part of a larger category of offenders. Dalindyebo last month disowned Azenathi and his claim to the throne, demanding a paternity test to establish if Azenathi was his son.
