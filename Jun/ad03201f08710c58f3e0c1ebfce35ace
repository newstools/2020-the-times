The DHL Stormers will bring their fire to DHL Newlands in a special live-streamed broadcast on Saturday July 4 with Bryan Habana, Elma Smit and Siv Ngesi. And, thanks to BrightRock, you could be there too, even if not in person – and stand a chance to win cash and a call from a DHL Stormers champion! DHL Newlands is SA’s oldest stadium, having hosted its first game in 1890. The opening match of the 1995 Rugby World Cup tournament was played there, and it is the home stadium of DHL Stormers captain Siya Kolisi, who lifted the World Cup in Japan. On July 4, some of the DHL Stormers’ finest players will set DHL Newlands alight in tribute, lighting braai fires on the field to remember the magical moments that have lit up the stadium over more than a century. Join us from your home as we pay tribute to the fans, the DHL Western Province and DHL Stormers teams, and all the magic moments that have made Newlands a special place. And, if you’re one of our winners, you might just see yourself on the big screen, lighting a fire for DHL Newlands. Play the bounce. Play the moment. Love change. Send us your most memorable DHL Newlands moments: you can write something, take a picture, scan or select an older photograph, or make a video, and then submit your entry by WhatsApp to 060 794 7516. We'll choose 10 great entries, each of which will be awarded R850 – plus these entries will make it onto the big screen at DHL Newlands that Saturday. Even better, the overall best entry will win R5,000 and that person will be called live on the day by one of the DHL Stormers players! Light up your braai at home and send in your festive family braai pics or videos by WhatsApp to 060 794 7516, and you could also make it onto the big screen as we celebrate at DHL Newlands.
