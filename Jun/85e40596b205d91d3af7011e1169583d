Making ads that resonate with an intended audience has always been a priority for advertisers. Historically however, prioritising certain groups ahead of others has resulted in the neglect and exclusion of some consumers. Right now, the world is acutely aware of these inequalities. So, how do advertisers position brands taking cultural diversity into account? In a country defined by 11 national languages and considerable socioeconomic divides, SA advertisers have an exciting challenge. It’s clear that a deeper understanding of language, culture and the prevailing mood are essential for establishing a relationship with consumers in a show of authentic empathy: to recognise and reflect the faces, lives and aspirations of consumers they wish to reach with their brand stories. And therein lies a dilemma: how granulated must advertising campaigns become to cater to diverse audiences? Can a single campaign hold appeal across a broad spectrum of consumers, and if so, how? Brands often define their character through the stories they tell, which either appeal or are ignored. They shape the connection between the brand and the consumer. So, how do agencies take into account all the differences, to build successful campaigns that unite consumers through their similarities?
