Devastated loved ones gathered on Wednesday to give a heartfelt send-off to 36-year-old Sibongiseni Gabada, who was found murdered and stuffed into a sports bag. Gabada is the latest victim in the ongoing spate of femicide in SA, including Tshegofatso Pule and Naledi Phangindawo, as well as countless others.
