Members of the community of Philippi in Cape Town braved heavy rain on Saturday to march to the Nyanga police station to protest against gender-based violence which has engulfed the country. A number of women and children  have been raped or killed by men in recent weeks, which has prompted a number of marches and President Cyril Ramaphosa to call for men to take the lead in the fight against violence on women and children.
