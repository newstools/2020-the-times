Despite the coronavirus lockdown, South Africans paid their respects at the Hector Pieterson memorial site in Soweto to commemorate Youth Day on June 16. Mmusi Maimane was among the crowd who visited the site to reflect on the legacy of the young activists who fought for educational and racial equality during the height of apartheid in 1976.
