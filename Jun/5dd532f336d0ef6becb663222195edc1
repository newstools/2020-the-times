Last Sunday, we introduced you to some of SAâ€™s lockdown heroes, who were among hundreds of inspiring people nominated by our readers. It was tough for our judges to award the prize, a R15,000 local holiday package each for our lockdown hero and for the nominator. But the stories that stood out were those of ordinary citizens who did what they could, often without any money or other resources. Our winner was Sandra Tshisa of Khayelitsha in the Western Cape, who started feeding hungry children in her neighbourhood by cooking soup and porridge on a two-plate stove in her small home, at first in a pot not even big enough to serve them all. We also highlighted 10 other people who had made a real effort to help their communities. Now, we are thrilled to announce that thanks to Tshedo Impact, a non-profit organisation launched four years ago by Harith General Partners CEO Tshepo Mahloele and his wife, Dolly, we can also award a cash prize of R15,000 to Sandra Tshisa and R10,000 each to our other highlighted heroes, to help them continue their good work. Tshedo Impact has been involved in various education initiatives since then and has also been assisting families with food parcels in Mabopane and Mamelodi.
