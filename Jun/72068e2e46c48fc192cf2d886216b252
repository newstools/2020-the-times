Pupils and teachers across the country officially return to schools on Monday, June 8, the first day of class during the Covid-19 lockdown for grades 7 and 12. After much trepidation from parents, pupils and teachers alike, schools say they're ready to continue the school year and are practising health and safety measures, including social distancing, routine screening before entering the premises and sanitising. Asivhanga transport which supplies transportation for school  said the 65 seater bus has been reduced to a 39 seater to adhere to the transport regulation. Learners are given masks at pickup points  The transport manager, Murendeni Tshikunde said most learners he was transporting seemed scared because of the virus. "Most learners are scared when we scan them they say they are scared that they might have coronavirus," he said.He said most concerned parents were relieved and happy when they saw the transport arrangements at the pickup point. Shared anxiety and determination united pupils and teachers at a Johannesburg school on Monday, the first day of class during the Covid-19 lockdown. "The pupils have been so well-behaved this morning, I am proud of them. They have been following social distancing measures," said Willie de Wet, principal of Roosevelt High School. The school has been ready to receive students since two weeks ago as staff had anticipated opening a week earlier. When more and more people returned to work on June 1, for some the lockdown nightmare intensified. Level 3 presents another set of worries, and rising costs, as only grades 7 and 12 are back in class. There will be no more false starts, and schools will open on Monday. And, the minister finally has the backing of teacher unions.
