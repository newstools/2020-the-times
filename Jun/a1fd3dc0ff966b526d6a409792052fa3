Two teachers from a high school in Ekurhuleni, east of Johannesburg, have died, the education department confirmed on Wednesday. The two teachers, a 63-year-old female acting principal and a 58-year-old female teacher from Thuto Lesedi Secondary School in Vosloorus, died on Tuesday. "It is alleged the acting principal collapsed while visiting her parents and was unfortunately declared dead on arrival at a local hospital," said the education department in a statement. "Sadly, the second educator allegedly experienced complications and consulted a medical practitioner. She died at home in her sleep." The department dispatched its psycho-social team to provide support to the school. “This is a huge loss for the school and the education sector in a difficult period,” said Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi. “We would like to convey our sincere condolences to both families and the school community. We pray for their strength during this time of grief.
